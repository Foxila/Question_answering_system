COOPERATIVE PATENT CLASSIFICATION
MEDICAL OR VETERINARY SCIENCE; HYGIENE
SPECIFIC THERAPEUTIC ACTIVITY OF CHEMICAL COMPOUNDS OR
1. This subclass covers therapeutic activity of chemical compounds or medicinal preparations already classified as such in
subclasses A61K or C12N, or in classes C01, C07 or C08
2. In this subclass, the term "drugs" includes chemical compounds or compositions with therapeutic activity.
3. In this subclass, therapeutic activity is classified in all appropriate places {to the extent of all the different therapeutic
activities stated in the claims and also significantly disclosed as examples in the disclosure}.
4. Attention is drawn to cases where the subject of the invention concerns only specific therapeutic activity of chemical
compounds or medical preparations, and the chemical structure, compound, mixture or composition of this subject of the
invention is known. In such cases, classification is made in both subclass A61K and subclass A61P as invention information.
In addition, if the chemical structure, compound, mixture or composition or any individual ingredient of a mixture or
composition is considered to represent information of interest for search, it may also be classified as additional information.
{There is no classification in C01, C07, C08, C12N as additional information in CPC if the chemical structure, compound,
mixture or composition or any individual ingredient of a mixture or composition is known and classification is made in both
subclass A61K and subclass A61P as invention information.}
5. The classification symbols of this subclass are not listed first when assigned to patent documents.
