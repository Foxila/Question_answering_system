In this subclass, the following expression is used with the meaning indicated:
â€¢ "physical therapy" covers the treatment of disease or disability by means, e.g. mechanical means, as opposed to drugs or
surgery. It includes, by way of example, massage, whirlpool baths or devices for exercising a passive body member.
In this subclass non-limiting references (in the sense of paragraph 39 of the Guide to the IPC) may still be displayed in the
