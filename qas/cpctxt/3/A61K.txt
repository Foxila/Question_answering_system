1. This subclass covers the following subject matter, whether set forth as a composition (mixture), process of preparing the
composition or process of treating using the composition:
a. Drug or other biological compositions which are capable of:
• preventing, alleviating, treating or curing abnormal or pathological conditions of the living body by such means
as destroying a parasitic organism, or limiting the effect of the disease or abnormality by chemically altering the
physiology of the host or parasite (biocides A01N 25/00 - A01N 65/00);
• maintaining, increasing, decreasing, limiting, or destroying a physiological body function, e.g. vitamin compositions,
sex sterilants, fertility inhibitors, growth promotors, or the like (sex sterilants for invertebrates, e.g. insects, A01N; plant
growth regulators A01N 25/00 - A01N 65/00);
• diagnosing a physiological condition or state by an in vivo test, e.g. X-ray contrast or skin patch test compositions
(measuring or testing processes involving enzymes or microorganisms C12Q; in vitro testing of biological material, e.g.
blood, urine, G01N, e.g. G01N 33/48)
b. Body treating compositions generally intended for deodorising, protecting, adorning or grooming the body, e.g. cosmetics,
dentifrices, tooth filling materials.
2. Attention is drawn to the definitions of groups of chemical elements following the title of section C.
3. Attention is drawn to the notes in class C07, for example the notes following the title of the subclass C07D, setting forth
the rules for classifying organic compounds in that class, which rules are also applicable, if not otherwise indicated, to the

4. In this subclass, with the exception of group A61K 8/00, the last place priority rule is applied, i.e. at each hierarchical level, in
the absence of an indication to the contrary, classification is made in the last appropriate place.
5. Therapeutic activity of medicinal preparations is further classified in subclass A61P.

   38/00    Medicinal preparations containing peptides
(peptides containing beta-lactam rings A61K 31/00;
cyclic dipeptides not having in their molecule any
other peptide link than those which form their ring,
e.g. piperazine-2,5-diones, A61K 31/00; ergot
alkaloids of the cyclic peptide type A61K 31/48;
containing macromolecular compounds having
statistically distributed amino acid units A61K 31/74;
medicinal preparations containing antigens or

characterised by the non-active ingredients, e.g.
peptides as drug carriers, A61K 47/00)
1. The terms or expressions used in this group follow
exactly the definitions given in Note (1) following
2. Preparations containing fragments of peptides
or peptides modified by removal or addition of
amino acids, by substitution of amino acids by
others, or by combination of these modifications
are classified as the preparations containing
parent peptides. However, preparations containing
fragments of peptides having only four or
less amino acids are also classified in groups
3. Preparations containing peptides prepared by
recombinant DNA technology are not classified
according to the host, but according to the original
peptide expressed, e.g. preparations containing
HIV peptide expressed in E. coli are classified
with the preparations containing HIV peptides.
4. This group covers also medicinal preparation
containing DNA or RNA encoding for peptides as
5. Documents relating to new peptides, e.g. enzymes,
or new DNA or RNA encoding for peptides and
their use in medicinal preparations are classified in
subclass C07K or in group C12N 9/00 according to
the peptides, with the appropriate indexing codes
relating to their medical uses.
