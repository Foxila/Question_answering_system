COOPERATIVE PATENT CLASSIFICATION
METALLURGY; FERROUS OR NON-FERROUS ALLOYS; TREATMENT OF
PRODUCTION AND REFINING OF METALS (electrolytic C25); PRETREATMENT OF
In this subclass, groups for obtaining metals include obtaining the metals by non-metallurgical processes, and obtaining metal
compounds by metallurgical processes, {as far as specifically indicated in the relevant groups} . Thus, for example, group
C22B 11/00 covers the production of silver by reduction of ammoniacal silver oxide in solution, and group C22B 17/00
includes the production of cadmium oxide by a metallurgical process. Furthermore, although compounds of arsenic and
antimony are classified in C01G, production of the elements themselves is included in C22B, as well as the production of their
compounds by metallurgical processes.

metal which is considered to represent information
of interest for search may also be classified in the
main groups only of C22B 11/00 - C22B 25/00,
in group C22B 19/34 or in any of groups
C22B 26/00 - C22B 61/00. This can for example,
be the case when it is considered of interest
to enable searching for extraction of specific
metals or their compounds. Such non-obligatory
classification should be given as "additional
