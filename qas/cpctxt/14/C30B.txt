1. In this subclass, the following expressions are used with the meaning indicated:
• "single-crystal" includes also twin crystals and a predominantly single crystal product;
• "homogeneous polycrystalline material" means a material with crystal particles, all of which have the same chemical
• "defined structure" means the structure of a material with grains which are oriented in a preferential way or have larger
dimensions than normally obtained.
• the preparation of crystals or a homogeneous polycrystalline material with defined structure of particular materials or
shapes is classified in the group for the process as well as in group C30B 29/00;
• an apparatus specially adapted for a specific process is classified in the appropriate group for the process. Apparatus to be
used in more than one kind of process is classified in group C30B 35/00.
