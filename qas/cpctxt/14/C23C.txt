In this subclass, an operation is considered as pre-treatment or after-treatment when it is specially adapted for, but quite
distinct from, the coating process concerned and constitutes an independent operation. If an operation results in the formation
of a permanent sub- or upper layer, it is not considered as pre-treatment or after-treatment and is classified as a multi-coating
