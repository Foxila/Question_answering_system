1. In this subclass, the first place priority rule is applied, i.e. at each hierarchical level, classification is made in the first
2. When classifying in this subclass{, subject matter of interest is also classified in other appropriate places:}
• library members are also classified in the appropriate places elsewhere in the IPC, (e.g. in section C) according to
established procedure relating to "Markush"-type formulae (see paragraph 100 and 101 of the Guide);
• {methods or apparatus covered by this subclass are also classified for their biological, chemical, physical or other features
in the appropriate places in the IPC, if such features are of interest, e.g.
Preparations for medical, dental or toilet purposes
Specific therapeutic activity of chemical compounds or medicinal preparations
Chemical or physical processes, e.g. catalysis; Apparatus therefor
Chemical or physical laboratory apparatus
Inorganic, organic or organic macromolecular compounds; Methods of preparation or
Biochemistry. microbiology, enzymology including microorganisms or enzymes,
preparing them, using them to synthesise compounds or compositions; Measuring
or testing processes involving microorganisms or enzymes; Mutation or genetic
Physical measurements methods; Apparatus therefor
Electrical digital data processing
