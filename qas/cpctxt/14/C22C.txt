COOPERATIVE PATENT CLASSIFICATION
METALLURGY; FERROUS OR NON-FERROUS ALLOYS; TREATMENT OF
ALLOYS (flints C06C 15/00; treatment of alloys C21D, C22F)
1. In this subclass, the following terms or expressions are used with the meanings indicated:
a. metallic composite materials containing a substantial  proportion of fibres or other somewhat larger particles;
b. ceramic compositions containing free metal bonded to carbides, diamond, oxides, borides, nitrides or silicides,  e.g.
cermets, or other metal compounds, e.g. oxynitrides or sulfides, other than as macroscopic reinforcing agents;
â€¢ "based on" requires at least 50% by weight of the specified constituent or of the specified group of constituents.
2. Groups C22C 43/00 - C22C 49/00 take precedence over groups C22C 1/00 - C22C 38/00.
{This Note corresponds to IPC Note (1) relating to C22C 1/00 - C22C 38/00.}
3. In groups C22C 37/00 and C22C 38/00, the last place priority rule is applied, i.e. at each hierarchical level, in the absence
of an indication to the contrary, an alloy is classified in the last appropriate place that provides for one of the alloying
components. {This Note corresponds to IPC Note (1) relating to C22C 37/00 - C22C 38/00.}
4. {In this subclass it is desirable to classify the individual aspects of combinations of processes or materials for powder
metallurgy using Combination Sets with symbols chosen from groups C22C 1/00 - C22C 43/00 or from groups
5. {In this subclass the special database "ALLOYS" is used. This system includes patent documents classified in groups
C22C 1/04 and C22C 5/00 - C22C 49/14 and provides information on the composition of the alloys, their uses and
