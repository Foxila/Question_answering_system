1. This subclass covers the making of metallic powder only insofar as powder with specific physical characteristics is made.
2. In this subclass, the term "powder" includes somewhat larger particles which are worked, obtained or behave in a manner
similar to powder, e.g. fibres.
3. In this subclass, the expression "metallic powder" covers:
• powders consisting of metal particles;
• powders consisting of coated metal particles;
• powders consisting of metal-coated non-metallic particles;
• mixtures of powders of the kinds mentioned above;
• powders of the kinds mentioned above as the main component mixed with or containing non-metallic material, e.g.
lubricating or binding agents or organic material.
4. {In this subclass, combination sets (C-Sets) are used. Detailed information about C-Sets construction and the associated
syntax rules is found in the definitions for B22F.}
