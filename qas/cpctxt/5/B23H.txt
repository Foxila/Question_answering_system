COOPERATIVE PATENT CLASSIFICATION
PERFORMING OPERATIONS; TRANSPORTING
MACHINE TOOLS; METAL-WORKING NOT OTHERWISE PROVIDED FOR
WORKING OF METAL BY THE ACTION OF A HIGH CONCENTRATION OF
ELECTRIC CURRENT ON A WORKPIECE USING AN ELECTRODE WHICH TAKES
THE PLACE OF A TOOL; SUCH WORKING COMBINED WITH OTHER FORMS
