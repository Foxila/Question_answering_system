COOPERATIVE PATENT CLASSIFICATION
PERFORMING OPERATIONS; TRANSPORTING
MECHANICAL METAL-WORKING WITHOUT ESSENTIALLY REMOVING
MAKING FORGED OR PRESSED METAL PRODUCTS, e.g. HORSE-SHOES, RIVETS,
BOLTS OR WHEELS (making particular articles by working sheet metal without essentially
removing material B21D; processing wire B21F; making pins, needles or nails B21G; making
particular articles by rolling B21H; forging machines, pressing machines, hammering machines,
in general B21J; making chains B21L; plating B23K)
This subclass includes only forging, pressing, or hammering operations which are specially adapted for use in the manufacture
of particular objects and which, sor far as the invention is concerned, are not combined with any different metal-working
operation unless the latter is a subsidiary operation performed in the same machine.
In this subclass non-limiting references (in the sense of paragraph 39 of the Guide to the IPC) may still be displayed in the
