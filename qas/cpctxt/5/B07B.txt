MATERIAL (wet separating processes, sorting by processes using fluent material in the same
way as liquid B03; combinations of dry separating apparatus with wet separating apparatus
B03B; using liquids B03B, B03D; sorting by magnetic or electrostatic separation of solid
materials from solid materials or fluids, separation by high voltage electric fields B03C;
centrifuges or vortex apparatus for carrying out physical processes B04; hand sorting, postal
sorting, sorting by switching or other devices actuated in response to detection or measurement
of some feature of articles or samples of material B07C)
In this subclass any sorting or grading of bulk material or loose articles fit to be handled like bulk material results
automatically from the construction of the apparatus and properties of the material, e.g. by a trap opening under an object of
a certain minimum weight, by an aperture of graduated size. Sorting of articles is included in so far as the same conditions
apply, e.g. sorting of timber by passing it over successively longer openings; the articles may or may not be orientated for the
