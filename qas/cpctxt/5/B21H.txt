COOPERATIVE PATENT CLASSIFICATION
PERFORMING OPERATIONS; TRANSPORTING
MECHANICAL METAL-WORKING WITHOUT ESSENTIALLY REMOVING
MAKING PARTICULAR METAL OBJECTS BY ROLLING, e.g. SCREWS, WHEELS,
RINGS, BARRELS, BALLS (essentially from sheet metal B21D)
This subclass covers rolling operations which are specially adapted for use in the manufacture of particular objects and which
are not essentially combined with any different metal-working operation unless the latter is a subsidiary operation performed
In this subclass non-limiting references (in the sense of paragraph 39 of the Guide to the IPC) may still be displayed in the
