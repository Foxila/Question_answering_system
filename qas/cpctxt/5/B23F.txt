COOPERATIVE PATENT CLASSIFICATION
PERFORMING OPERATIONS; TRANSPORTING
MACHINE TOOLS; METAL-WORKING NOT OTHERWISE PROVIDED FOR
MAKING GEARS OR TOOTHED RACKS (by stamping B21D; by rolling B21H; by forging
or pressing B21K; by casting B22; arrangements for copying or controlling B23Q; machines or
devices for grinding or polishing, in general B24B)
• the use of methods or apparatus specially designed to produce accurately the shapes of gear teeth which are essential for
proper intermeshing of toothed gearing elements to ensure the required relative motions;
• the use of similar methods or apparatus in the production of other articles of toothed or like form, e.g. dog clutches, splined
2. This subclass does not cover the production of such other articles of toothed or like form using methods or apparatus other
than those mentioned under Note (1) above.
3. In this subclass, the following terms or expressions are used with the meanings indicated:
• "gear teeth" covers the teeth or lobes of other accurately-intermeshing members having relative movement of a similar
kind, such as rotors of rotary pumps and blowers;
• "profile" may include the outline of both faces or only one face of a tooth, or the opposing faces of adjacent teeth;
• "straight" means that a tooth as a whole (ignoring any curvature of the tooth-face alone, e.g. crowning) is straight in the
direction of its length, for example as seen in the direction of a radius of a spur wheel. It accordingly includes the teeth of
helical gears and of the normal type of bevel gear;
• "broach-milling" means milling with a rotary cutter having a number of teeth of progressively increasing depth or width.
In this subclass non-limiting references (in the sense of paragraph 39 of the Guide to the IPC) may still be displayed in the
