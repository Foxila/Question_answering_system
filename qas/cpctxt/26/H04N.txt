PICTORIAL COMMUNICATION, e.g. TELEVISION
• transmission of pictures or their transient or permanent reproduction either locally or remotely {and the corresponding
electronic image capture and reproduction process employing image representative electric signals}, by methods involving
both of {or at least one of} the following steps:
a. the {electronic acquisition or} scanning of a picture {or scene}, i.e. resolving the whole picture-containing area into
individual picture-elements and the derivation of picture-representative electric signals related thereto, simultaneously
or in sequence {, e.g. by reading an electronic solid-state image sensor [SSIS] pickup device, e.g. CCD or CMOS image
sensor, as electronic image sensor converting optical image information into said electrical signals};
b. the reproduction of the whole picture-containing area {or scene} by the reproduction of individual picture -elements
into which the picture is resolved by means of picture -representative electric signals derived therefrom, simultaneously

3. In this subclass, the following expression is used with the meaning indicated:

4. {In this subclass, as in subclass G03B, the following terms are used with the meaning indicated:
"camera": a device capturing image information represented by light patterns reflected or emitted from objects,
and exposing a light sensitive film or a main electronic image sensor during a timed exposure, usually through
a photographic lens, and producing an image on a light sensitive film or an electrical image information signal
"projector": a device displaying image information by projection of light patterns, usually through an optical lens,
wherein the light patterns are generated by illuminating an image, e.g. film or slide, or by converting an electric image
signal into an optical signal using an electronic spatial light modulator;
"electronic image sensor [EIS]": optoelectronic transducer, converting optical image information into an electrical
signal susceptible of being processed, stored, transmitted or displayed;
"additional sensor": a sensor, other than the main electronic image sensor, used for controlling a camera;
"electronic spatial light modulator [ESLM]": optoelectronic transducer converting electric signals representing image

However, video will occupy most of the

is applied, i.e. at each hierarchical level, in
the absence of an indication to the contrary,
classification is made in the first appropriate place.
3. In this main group, the following terms and
expressions are used with the meaning indicated:
additional data - designates still pictures,
textual, graphical or executable data such as
software. It is used to convey supplemental
information and can be generated prior to
or during the distribution process itself, e.g.
content designates video or audio streams,
which may be combined with additional
data. Video data will always be present and
occupy most of the downlink bandwidth in the
server - designates an apparatus designed
for adapting the content received from the
content provider to the distribution network.
It also manages the distribution to client
devices or intermediate components over a
network. Further servers may also be present
for gathering or generating additional data, e.g.
additional data server - designates a server,
which sole purpose is the distribution or
management of additional data. It is not in
charge of the distribution of video or audio data
client - designates an apparatus such as a TV
receiver, a set-top-box, a PC-TV, a mobile
appliance (e.g. mobile phone or receiver in
a vehicle), for receiving video, audio and
possibly additional data from one or several
servers or intermediate components via a
network for further processing, storing or
displaying. It can also transmit this data on a
home-based local network to further devices,
e.g. a home server transmitting video to PCs
and set-top-boxes within a home.
local network - pertains to a restricted area, e.g.
a home or a vehicle, and designates the link
between a client and its peripheral devices
network - is to be distinguished from "local
network": "network" designates the link
between the server and the clients, or between
the server and the intermediate components, or
between the intermediate components and the
clients, or between remotely located clients
distribution - encompasses broadcasting,
multicasting and unicasting techniques
for transmitting content from one or more
sources to one or more receiving stations. The
distribution follows a request by a receiving
station to the source, e.g. VOD or from a
customization of the content by the source,
e.g. targeting advertisements to a demographic
group in a unidirectional or bidirectional
system. Additionally, distribution encompasses
techniques where the client acts as a source and
another client acts as a receiving station, e.g. a
peer-to-peer system for sharing video among
end-user - designates a physical person, e.g. a
TV viewer, who consumes the content using
the client device. He is the final recipient of the
content distributed by the server
interaction - covers actions occurring between
or among two or more objects that have an
effect upon one another, wherein objects
comprise users, system operators, system
elements, or content. The user may interact
with content locally at the client device, e.g.
for requesting additional data stored within
the client device. The user may interact with
content remotely through a server e.g. for
VOD playback control or for uploading video
to a server. The client device may interact
with the content e.g. selecting content based
upon the user profile. The client device may
interact with a server using a return channel,
e.g. for authenticating client or uploading client
hardware capabilities. The server may interact
with a client device, e.g. to force a client to tune
upstream - designates the direction of data flow
towards the source, e.g. a server receiving a
request via a mobile phone network.
downstream - designates the direction of data
flow towards a client, e.g. a client receiving
data originating from a server elementary
stream An elementary stream (ES) as defined
by the MPEG system layer designates the
output of an audio or video encoder.
