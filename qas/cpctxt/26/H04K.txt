SECRET COMMUNICATION; JAMMING OF COMMUNICATION
In this subclass, the following expression is used with the meaning indicated:
â€¢ "secret communication" includes secret line and radiation transmission systems, i.e. those in which apparatus at the
transmitting station modifies the signal in such a way that the information cannot be intelligibly received without
corresponding modifying apparatus at the receiving station.
