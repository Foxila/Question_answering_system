COOPERATIVE PATENT CLASSIFICATION
ELECTRIC COMMUNICATION TECHNIQUE
BROADCAST COMMUNICATION (multiplex communication H04J; pictorial
communication aspects of broadcast systems H04N)
In this subclass, the following terms or expressions are used with the meaning indicated:
• "broadcast" is simultaneous distribution of identical signals to plural receiving stations. The term "broadcast" does not
include distribution to receiving stations which is controlled by requests or responses from the receiving stations;
• "broadcast information" covers all kinds of information distributed by broadcast systems;
• "broadcast-related information" is information required by services provided via broadcast systems, other than broadcast
• "broadcast time" is a time when particular broadcast information exists and is available;
• "broadcast channel" is a channel via which broadcast information is distributed, e.g. carrier waves, time slots, cables or
wireless broadcast service areas;
• "broadcast space" is either a set of broadcast channels in which particular broadcast information exists and is available or a
geographical area determined by the set of broadcast channels;
• "broadcast space-time" is space-time determined by broadcast space and broadcast time in which particular broadcast
information exists and is available;
• "broadcast system" is a system which consists of transmitter, transponder and receiver for broadcast;
• "broadcast-related system" is a system which is directly affected by generation, broadcast, reception or use of broadcast
• "broadcast service" is a service directly provided by a broadcast system, i.e. distribution service of broadcast information;
• "broadcast-related service" is a service provided by broadcast-related systems;
• "A with a direct linkage to B" means that A directly affects B or that A is directly affected by B.
