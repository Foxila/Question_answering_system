CONTROL OR REGULATION OF ELECTRIC MOTORS, ELECTRIC GENERATORS
OR DYNAMO-ELECTRIC CONVERTERS; CONTROLLING TRANSFORMERS,
1. This subclass covers arrangements for starting, regulating, electronically commutating, braking, or otherwise controlling
motors, generators, dynamo-electric converters, clutches, brakes, gears, transformers, reactors or choke coils, of the types
classified in the relevant subclasses, e.g.  H01F, H02K.
2. This subclass does not cover similar arrangements for the apparatus of the types classified in subclass  H02N, which
arrangements are covered by that subclass.
3. In this subclass, the following terms or expressions are used with the meanings indicated:
• "control" means influencing a variable in any way, e.g. changing its direction or its value (including changing it to or from
zero), maintaining it constant or limiting its range of variation;
• "regulation" means maintaining a variable at a desired value, or within a desired range of values, by comparison of the
actual value with the desired value.
4. In this subclass, it is desirable to add the indexing codes of groups H02P 2101/00 and H02P 2103/00
In this subclass non-limiting references (in the sense of paragraph 39 of the Guide to the IPC) may still be displayed in the
