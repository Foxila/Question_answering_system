ELECTRIC COMMUNICATION TECHNIQUE
INDEXING SCHEME RELATING TO STANDARDS FOR ELECTRIC
COMMUNICATION TECHNIQUE (CLASS H04)
1. This scheme constitutes an non-associated internal scheme for indexing exclusively documents issued by standardisation
bodies (herein called standards) for electric communication technique (H04).
As standardisation bodies organize their documents in different ways, the present scheme is subdivided into main groups
related to a particular CPC range to allow different indexing approaches.
Wireless communication standards       H04T 2001/00       -       H04T 2001/231
Standards related to data switching
networks in general       H04T 2012/00       -       H04T 2012/00
Internet standards       H04T 2029/00       -       H04T 2029/06
 2001/00    Standards for wireless communication networks
The indexing codes of this scheme are to be used
mainly with classification in CPC subgroups
In order to keep the structure adopted by the
standardisation bodies considered, a matrix type of
scheme is used as indicated below:
• H04T 2001/101 - H04T 2001/113 codes are
used for information relating to the physical
aspects,  e.g. radio resources, core network
• H04T 2001/201 - H04T 2001/231 codes are
used for information relating to functional
aspects, e.g.  physical layer, traffic/transport...
For complete indexing it is mandatory to allocate
at least one and preferably only one combination
of  H04T2001/100 and H04T2001/200 codes to a
Searching in this scheme is done by combining
the above indicated codes, i.e. H04T2001/100 and
