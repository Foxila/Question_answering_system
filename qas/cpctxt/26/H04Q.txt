COOPERATIVE PATENT CLASSIFICATION
ELECTRIC COMMUNICATION TECHNIQUE
SELECTING (switches, relays, selectors H01H; wireless communication networks H04W)
• methods, circuits, or apparatus for stablishing selectively  a connect ion between a desired number of stations (normally
two), or between a main station and a desired number of  substations (normally one) for the purpose of transferring
information via this connection after it has been established;
• selective calling arrangements over connections already  established.
In either case, the connection may be made by means of electric conductors or electromagnetic waves.
2. In this subclass, the following terms or expressions are used with the meanings indicated:
• "subscriber" is a general term for terminal equipment, e.g. telephone for public use;
• "substation" means a subscriber or monitoring equipment which may connect a single subscriber to a line without choice as
• "satellite" is a kind of exchange the operation of which depends upon control signals received from a supervisory
• "switching centres" includes exchanges and satellites.
In this subclass non-limiting references (in the sense of paragraph 39 of the Guide to the IPC) may still be displayed in the
