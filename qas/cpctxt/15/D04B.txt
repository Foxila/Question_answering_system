COOPERATIVE PATENT CLASSIFICATION
TEXTILES OR FLEXIBLE MATERIALS NOT OTHERWISE PROVIDED FOR
BRAIDING; LACE-MAKING; KNITTING; TRIMMINGS; NON-WOVEN FABRICS
1. In this subclass, the groups designating machines, apparatus, devices, or implements include processes characterised by, or
dependent on, their use and the products of such processes
2. Knitted products, i.e. fabrics, articles, are classified in this subclass only if they have constructional features which are of
interest from the knitting aspect
3. In this subclass, further classification in indexing scheme D10B for aspects relating to textiles is required.
In this subclass non-limiting references (in the sense of paragraph 39 of the Guide to the IPC) may still be displayed in the
