1. In this subclass, the following terms or expressions are used with the meaning indicated:
• "fabric" includes yarns in warp or sheet form;
• "textile material" includes fabrics, yarns or other fibrous materials;
• "indefinite length" means an extent of material having the characteristic that the longitudinal dimension is effectively
infinite in so far as the procedure for advancing or moving   the material is concerned.
2. This subclass does not cover treatment of textiles by purely chemical means, which is covered by subclasses D06L - D06Q.
{In this subclass non-limiting references (in the sense of paragraph 39 of the Guide to the IPC) may still be displayed in the
