1. In this subclass, the following terms or expressions are used with the meaning indicated:
• "non-woven fabrics" means fabrics formed wholly or partly of textile material by processes comprising operations other
than the weaving, knitting, braiding, lacing or knotting of yarns, threads or filaments for which provision is made in other
subclasses of section D. This expression includes felts, cotton-wool and wadding;
• "fibre" means a relatively-short, elongated member of natural or man-made material;
• "filament" means an endless or quasi-endless, elongated member of natural or man-made material;
• "yarn" means a unitary assembly of fibres, usually produced by spinning;
• "thread" means an assembly of yarns or filaments, usually produced by twisting;
• "synthetic" fibres or filaments means fibres or filaments or the like manufactured from synthesising polymers or small
molecules. Examples are polyamide, acrylic, polyester or carbon fibres;
• "artificial" fibres or filaments means fibres or filaments or the like manufactured by man from natural polymers or their
derivatives. Examples are regenerated cellulosic fibres or semi-synthetic fibres;
• "man-made" fibres or filaments means fibres or filaments which are manufactured by man including "synthetic" or
• some of the non-woven fabrics can also be regarded as "layered products" within the meaning of subclass B32B, and
further classification in that subclass should be considered in accordance with the notes thereto;
• in cases where the making of non-woven fabrics involves the use of particular chemical compounds or compositions,
e.g. for treating or bonding fibres, filaments or yarns, further classification in other appropriate subclasses should also be
3. By varying the proportions of fibres or threads, and the chemical compounds or compositions, the final products may be given
the appearance of paper, cardboard, leather or the like.
