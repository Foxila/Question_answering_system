COOPERATIVE PATENT CLASSIFICATION
TEXTILES OR FLEXIBLE MATERIALS NOT OTHERWISE PROVIDED FOR
WOVEN FABRICS; METHODS OF WEAVING; LOOMS
1. Class D06 takes precedence over this subclass in respect of processes involving both weaving and finishing steps and in
respect of the finished fabrics.
2. A method of weaving is classified in the group designating the fabric woven unless the method is characterised by the
operation of a particular loom rather than by the production of a particular fabric. In this case, the method is classified in the
3. In this subclass, further classification in indexing scheme D10B for aspects relating to textiles is required.
4. In this subclass, if there is any doubt as to which of the essential features is the most important (this is usually the most
restrictive feature), the groups designating woven fabrics should be considered in the order in which they appear at each
level of indentation, except that groups designating woven pile fabrics are to be considered as taking precedence over groups
designating other woven fabrics.
{In this subclass non-limiting references (in the sense of paragraph 39 of the Guide to the IPC) may still be displayed in the
