their assemblies or integrated devices; their manufacture or treatment;
b. semiconductor devices sensitive to radiation; their constructional details or arrangements; their assemblies or integrated
devices; their manufacture or treatment;
c. semiconductor devices for light emission; their constructional details or arrangements; their assemblies or integrated
devices; their manufacture or treatment;
d. processes or apparatus for the manufacture or treatment of semiconductor or solid-state devices where the type of device is

3. In this subclass, the following terms or expressions are used with the meaning indicated:
• "wafer" means a slice of semiconductor or crystalline substrate material, which can be modified by impurity diffusion
(doping), ion implantation or epitaxy, and whose active surface can be processed into arrays of discrete components or
• "solid state body" means the body of material within which, or at the surface of which, the physical effects characteristic of
• "electrode" is a region in or on the body of the device (other than the solid state body itself), which exerts an electrical
influence on the solid state body, irrespective of whether or not an external electrical connection is made thereto. An
electrode may include several portions and the term includes metallic regions which exert influence on the solid state body
through an insulating region (e.g. capacitive coupling) and inductive coupling arrangements to the body. The dielectric
region in a capacitive arrangement is regarded as part of the electrode. In arrangements including several portions, only
those portions which exert an influence on the solid state body by virtue of their shape, size, or disposition or the material
of which they are formed are considered to be part of the electrode. The other portions are considered to be "arrangements
for conducting electric current to or from the solid state body" or "interconnections between solid state components formed
in or on a common substrate", i.e. leads;
• "device" means an electric circuit element; where an electric circuit element is one of a plurality of elements formed in or
on a common substrate it is referred to as a "component";
• "complete device" is a device in its fully assembled state which may or may not require further treatment, e.g.
electroforming, before it is ready for use but which does not require the addition of further structural units;
• "parts" includes all structural units which are included in a complete device;
• "container" is an enclosure forming part of the complete device and is essentially a solid construction in which the body of
the device is placed, or which is formed around the body without forming an intimate layer thereon. An enclosure which
consists of one or more layers formed on the body and in intimate contact therewith is referred to as an "encapsulation";
• "integrated circuit" is a device where all components, e.g. diodes or resistors, are built up on a common substrate and form
the device including interconnections between the components;
• "assembly" of a device is the building up of the device from its constructional units; the term covers the provision of
