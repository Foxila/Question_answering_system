In this subclass, it is desirable to add the indexing codes of subclasses F21W and F21Y.
The following IPC groups are not in the CPC scheme. The subject matter for these IPC groups is classified in the following
    2/00    Non-electric light sources using luminescence
(using excitation by radioactivity G21H 3/02,
H01J 65/06, H01J 65/08; using excitation by
an external electromagnetic field or by external
corpuscular radiation H01J 65/04); Light sources
    2/005   . {excited by infra-red radiation using up-conversion}
    2/04    . using triboluminescence; using thermoluminescence
    2/06    . using chemiluminescence
    2/08    . . activated by an electric field, i.e.
    5/00    Light sources using charges of combustible

1. In this group, the following expressions are used
• "light source" means a light-generating
component intended for installation in a fitting
or holder incorporated in a lighting device;
• "retrofit light source" means a light source
comprising substantially the same attachment
means as those of incandescent lamps or
fluorescent lamps. "Retrofit light sources" are
specially adapted for replacing or substituting
2. Semiconductor devices per se, or assemblies
thereof, specially adapted for light emission,
e.g. for use in light sources (in the sense of
Note (1)) are covered by subclasses H01L (e.g.
H01L 33/00), H01S (e.g. H01S 5/00) or class
H10 and subclass H10K (e.g. H10K 50/00 and
3. Lighting devices or systems in which light sources
are used are covered by subclasses F21L or F21S.
4. When classifying in this group, classification
is also made in subclass F21V if detail aspects
covered by that subclass are of interest.
