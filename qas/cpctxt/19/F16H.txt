1. Combinations including mechanical gearings are classified in groups F16H 37/00 or F16H 47/00, unless they are provided for
in groups F16H 1/00 - F16H 35/00.
2. In this subclass, sets of rigidly-connected members are regarded as single members.
3. In this subclass, the following terms or expressions are used with the meanings indicated:
• "toothed gearing" includes worm gearing and other gearing involving at least one wheel or sector provided with teeth  or
the equivalent, EXCEPT gearing with chains or toothed  belts, which is treated as friction gearing;
• "conveying motion" includes transmitting energy, and means  that the applied and resultant motions are of the same  kind,
though they may differ in, e.g. speed, direction  extent:
• "rotary" implies that the motion may continue indefinitely;
• "oscillating" means moving about an axis to an extent which  is limited by the construction of the gearing, and which
may exceed one revolution, the movement being alternately  forwards and backwards during continued operation of the
• "reciprocating" means moving substantially in a straight  line, the movement being alternately forwards and backwards
during continued operation of the gearing;
• "reversing" or "reversal" means that an applied movement in  one direction may produce a resultant movement in either of
two opposed directions at will;
• "central gears" includes any gears whose axis is the main  axis of the gearing.
4. Attention is drawn to the following places:
Gearings in harvesting machines
Toothed-wheel gearing for metal-rolling mills
Arrangement of transmissions in vehicles
Transmissions for railway locomotives
Transmissions for marine propulsions
