LIGHTING DEVICES SPECIALLY ADAPTED FOR VEHICLE EXTERIORS
• devices or systems intended for fixed installation or for use at a permanent location, e.g. free-standing floor- or table-
• aspects related to the optical, mechanical, thermal or electrical arrangement of elements in vehicle illuminating devices
specially adapted for vehicle exterior, e.g. headlamps.

2. This subclass does not cover:
• devices or systems specially adapted for transportation, which are covered by subclass F21L.
• aspects related to the vehicles in which lighting devices are arranged, e.g. the arrangement or operation of lighting devices
on vehicles, which are covered by B60Q.
