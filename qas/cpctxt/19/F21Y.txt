RELATING TO THE FORM OR THE KIND OF THE LIGHT SOURCES OR OF THE
This subclass constitutes an indexing scheme associated with subclasses F21K, F21L, F21S and F21V, relating to the form or
the kind of the light sources, or of the colour of the light emitted.
 2101/00    Point-like light sources
 2103/00    Elongate light sources, e.g. fluorescent tubes
 2103/10    . comprising a linear array of point-like light-
 2103/20    . of polygonal shape, e.g. square or rectangular
 2105/00    Planar light sources
 2105/10    . comprising a two-dimensional array of point-like
 2105/12    . . characterised by the geometrical disposition of
the light-generating elements, e.g. arranging
light-generating elements in differing patterns or
 2105/14    . . characterised by the overall shape of the two-
 2105/16    . . . square or rectangular, e.g. for light panels
 2105/18    . . . annular; polygonal other than square or
rectangular, e.g. for spotlights or for generating
