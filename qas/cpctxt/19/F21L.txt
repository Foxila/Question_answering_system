COOPERATIVE PATENT CLASSIFICATION
MECHANICAL ENGINEERING; LIGHTING; HEATING; WEAPONS; BLASTING
LIGHTING DEVICES OR SYSTEMS THEREOF, BEING PORTABLE OR SPECIALLY
1. This subclass covers devices or systems designed or specially adapted to be carried, e.g. by hand, or otherwise transported
from place to place, e.g. on wheeled supports, in order to provide illumination as and where required.
2. This subclass does not cover devices or systems intended for fixed installation, e.g. vehicle lighting, or for use essentially at a
permanent location, which are covered by subclass F21S.
3. Non-electric lighting devices are classified in groups F21L 17/00-F21L 26/00 only if a special adaptation related to the use of
a non-electric light source is of interest.
In this subclass non-limiting references (in the sense of paragraph 39 of the Guide to the IPC) may still be displayed in the
