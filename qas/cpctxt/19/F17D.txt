COOPERATIVE PATENT CLASSIFICATION
MECHANICAL ENGINEERING; LIGHTING; HEATING; WEAPONS; BLASTING
STORING OR DISTRIBUTING GASES OR LIQUIDS
PIPE-LINE SYSTEMS; PIPE-LINES (pumps or compressors F04; fluid dynamics F15D;
valves or the like F16K; pipes, laying pipes, supports, joints, branches, repairing, work on
the entire line, accessories F16L; steam traps or the like F16T; fluid-pressure electric cables
In this subclass, pipe-line systems are interpreted as systems described in flow sheets as well as arrangements of co-operating
elements, the elements per se being covered in the relevant subclasses.
In this subclass non-limiting references (in the sense of paragraph 39 of the Guide to the IPC) may still be displayed in the
