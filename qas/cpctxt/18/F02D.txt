• "fuel injection" means the introduction of a combustible substance into a space, e.g. cylinder, by means of a pressure
source, e.g. a pump, continuously or cyclically acting behind the substance;
• "supercharging" means supplying to the working space, e.g. cylinder, combustion-air pressurised by means of a pressure
