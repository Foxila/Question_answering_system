1. Attention is drawn to the notes preceding class F01.
2. Combinations of pumps belonging to this subclass with other pumps are only classified in this subclass if such other pumps
are fore pumps of diffusion pumps.
In this subclass non-limiting references (in the sense of paragraph 39 of the Guide to the IPC) may still be displayed in the
