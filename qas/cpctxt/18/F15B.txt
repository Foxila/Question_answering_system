SYSTEMS ACTING BY MEANS OF FLUIDS IN GENERAL; FLUID-PRESSURE
ACTUATORS, e.g. SERVOMOTORS; DETAILS OF FLUID-PRESSURE SYSTEMS,
In this subclass, the following terms are used with the meaning stated:
• "Telemotor" means a system or device in which a substantially constant amount of fluid is trapped between an input
member  and an output member to act as a fluid link;
• "Servomotor" means a fluid-pressure actuator, e.g. a piston and cylinder, directly controlled by a valve or other device
which is responsive to operation of an initial controlling member; "Servomotor" does not cover a telemotor. The initial
controlling member may be adjacent to the servomotor or at a distance, and may be, for example a hand lever.
