1. In this subclass, the following terms or expressions are used with the meanings indicated:
• "positive ignition" means ignition by a source external to the working fluid, e.g. by spark or incandescent source;
• "charging" means forcing air or fuel-air mixture into engine cylinders, and thus includes supercharging;
• "scavenging" means forcing the combustion residues from the cylinders other than by movement of the working pistons,
and thus includes tuned exhaust systems.
2. Attention is drawn to the Notes preceding class F01, especially as regards Note (1).
3. Engines with specified cycles or number of cylinders are classified in group F02B 75/02 or F02B 75/16, unless other
classifying features predominate.
