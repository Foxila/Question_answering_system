This subclass comprises boundary-layer control and other arrangements and methods, not provided for in other classes, for
influencing the flow of fluids relative to constraining surfaces and after leaving these surfaces, e.g. producing or removing
turbulence, deflecting jets, guiding flow through bends in conduits, affecting distribution of fluid in a conduit, reducing fluid
In this subclass non-limiting references (in the sense of paragraph 39 of the Guide to the IPC) may still be displayed in the
