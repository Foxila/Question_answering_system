1. This subclass covers non-positive-displacement pumps for liquids, for elastic fluids, or for liquids and elastic fluids whether
rotary or not having pure rotation.
2. This subclass does not cover combinations of non-positive-displacement pumps with other pumps, which are covered by
subclass F04B, except that the use of such other pumps for priming or boosting non-positive-displacement is covered by this
3. Attention is drawn to the Notes preceding class F01, especially as regards the definition of "pump".
