MIXTURES OR CONSTITUENTS THEREOF
1. Attention is drawn to the notes preceding class F01.
2. In this subclass the following terms are used with the meanings indicated:
• "Carburettors" means essentially apparatus for mixing fuel with air,  the fuel being brought into mixing contact with the air
by lowering the  air pressure, e.g. in a venturi;
• "Fuel injection apparatus" means apparatus for introducing fuel into a space,  e.g. engine cylinder, by pressurising the
fuel, e.g. by a pump acting behind   the fuel, and thus embraces the so-called "solid fuel injection" in which   liquid fuel is
introduced without any admixture of gas;
• "Low-pressure fuel injection" means fuel injection in which the fuel-air  mixture containing fuel thus injected will be
substantially compressed in   the compression stroke of the engine;
• "Pumping element" means a single piston-cylinder unit in a reciprocating-piston  fuel-injection pump or the equivalent unit
in any other type of fuel-injection  pump.
