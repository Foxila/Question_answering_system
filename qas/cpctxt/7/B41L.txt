APPARATUS OR DEVICES FOR MANIFOLDING, DUPLICATING OR PRINTING
FOR OFFICE OR OTHER COMMERCIAL PURPOSES; ADDRESSING MACHINES
OR LIKE SERIES-PRINTING MACHINES (printing presses or machines for industrial
purposes B41F; stamps, stamping or numbering devices B41K)
1. This subclass does not cover constituent parts common to manifolding by means of pressure-sensitive layers or intermediaries,
to apparatus or machines for duplicating or printing for office or other commercial purposes, or to addressing machines or like
series-printing machines, which are covered by subclass B41F.
2. In this subclass, as indicated by the references, groups B41L 15/00 and B41L 17/00 are intended to cover letterpress and
lithographic printing apparatus only in so far as it is specially adapted for office or other commercial purposes; the general
constructions or features of apparatus of these types are classified in subclass B41F. Constructions or features determining
classification in these groups are, for example: ease of operation by clerical staff, cleanliness of operation in non-industrial
environments, the use of printing surfaces constructed for the production of a limited number of copies.
3. In this subclass, the following terms are used with the meanings indicated:
• "manifolding" means the obtaining of several copies simultaneously by means of pressure-sensitive layers when making an
• "duplicating" means the obtaining of successive copies from a master, e.g. a hectographic image;
• "stencilling" involves the use of a printing surface which is perforated to form the image, the ink flowing through the
perforations on the copy material.
In this subclass non-limiting references (in the sense of paragraph 39 of the Guide to the IPC) may still be displayed in the
