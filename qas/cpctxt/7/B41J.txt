PRINTING OTHERWISE THAN FROM A FORME; CORRECTION OF
• manually controlled power-operated apparatus or apparatus of this type with additional control by input of recorded
information, e.g. on punched cards or tapes;
• the "print-out" features of apparatus controlled by record carriers or electric signals in so far as these are of general interest,
e.g. impression, inking, line-spacing mechanisms, printing heads.
2. This subclass does not cover:
• electrical features of apparatus controlled by record carriers or electric signals and of interest apart from the "print-out"
• apparatus controlled by record carriers or electric signals, as a whole.
3. In this subclass, the following term is used with the meaning indicated:
• "paper" covers also similar flexible copy material;
• "printing material" covers both paper and temporary record carriers from which records are transferred to a paper, but does
not cover printing masters, e.g. formes.
