COOPERATIVE PATENT CLASSIFICATION
PERFORMING OPERATIONS; TRANSPORTING
WORKING OR PRESERVING WOOD OR SIMILAR MATERIAL; NAILING OR
MANUFACTURE BY DRY PROCESSES OF ARTICLES, WITH OR WITHOUT
ORGANIC BINDING AGENTS, MADE FROM PARTICLES OR FIBRES CONSISTING
OF WOOD OR OTHER LIGNOCELLULOSIC OR LIKE ORGANIC MATERIAL
(containing cementitious material B28B; shaping of substances in a plastic state B29C;
fibreboards made from fibrous suspensions D21J; drying F26B 17/00)
This subclass does not cover treatment of compositions which are in a plastic state, or worked by the same type of process or
apparatus as plastics, which is covered by subclass B29B or B29C.
In this subclass non-limiting references (in the sense of paragraph 39 of the Guide to the IPC) may still be displayed in the
