LAYERED PRODUCTS, i.e. PRODUCTS BUILT-UP OF STRATA OF FLAT OR NON-
FLAT, e.g. CELLULAR OR HONEYCOMB, FORM
• layered products comprising different kinds of material or  layered products not characterised by the particular kind  of
• a product similar to a layered product but comprising only  material in the form of a sheet or network embedded in a  mass
of plastics or of physically-similar substances which  mass penetrates the said sheet or network and lies on both  sides of
the latter (e.g. so that the sheet or network  reinforces the plastics substance) PROVIDED THAT the  embedded sheet or
network extends coherently or connectedly  over substantially the whole area of the product; thus the  embedded sheet or
network may be a fabric or a series of  rods connected by cross wires. The manner of making such a  product is, however,
classified in this subclass only if it  is essentially a process of building-up an assembly of layers  of which at least one outer
layer is preformed. If the  embedded material comprises only a series of unconnected  rods, the product is not classified in
2. This subclass does not cover:
• processes or apparatus used in, or in connection with, the  production or treatment of any product, if the process or
apparatus is fully classifiable in a single other class or  subclass for processes or apparatus, e.g. B05, B29, B44D, C08J,
• compositions or preparation or treatment thereof, unless  they are essentially restricted to layered products and  cannot be
fully classified in another class without  ignoring this restriction;
• etched metallic pattern on the surface of a printed circuit board.
• a film formed on a layer by spreading a substance thereon is not considered to constitute a layer itself if it serves only as an
adhesive or its purpose is merely to finish a surface of a product
• {with exclusion to B32B 15/01 - B32B 15/018, a coating formed directly onto a substrate layer is not considered to
constitute a layer when at the moment of its contact with the substrate it does not have the form of a layer with the
exception of layers that come under the meaning of Note (4).}
• {groups designating products cover also methods or apparatus specially adapted for producing such products.}
4. In this subclass, the following terms or expressions are used with the meanings indicated:
• "layer" is a sheet or strip or anything else having a small thickness relatively to its other dimensions which, together with
at least one other layer, exists in a product, whether it pre-existed, e.g. as a separate sheet or strip, or was formed during the
production of the layered product{, e.g. formed in-situ as with casting, extrusion or moulding. It may be deformed out of
the flat plane to form a three-dimensional shape}. It may or may not be homogeneous or cohesive; it may be an assembly
of fibres or pieces of material. It may be discontinuous, e.g. in the form of a grating, honeycomb, or frame. It may or may
not be in complete contact with the next layer, e.g. a corrugated layer against a flat layer;
• "layered product" comprises at least two layers secured together. The term "secured" includes any method of uniting
layers, e.g. needling, stitching, gluing, nailing, dovetailing or the interposition of an adhesive or adhesive impregnated
support. It may also be an intermediate stage in the production of an article which is not layered in its final form, e.g. a
panel with a protective layer {that} is stripped off when the panel is placed in its position of use. The layers are preformed
layers or layers formed IN SITU on a preformed layer and may consist of coherent solid materials, including honeycombs
and other cellular materials or of non-coherent solid materials composed of assemblies of strands, strips, fibres, tiles or the
• "filamentary layer" means a layer of threads or filaments of any substance (e.g. wires) of more or less unlimited length
placed in an orderly arrangement and secured together; it may be woven, knitted, braided, or netted, or formed of threads
crossed or laid side by side and bonded together;
• "fibrous layer" means a random assembly of fibres or filaments, usually of limited length, e.g. felt, fleece; the fibres
{being} interengaged or connected, e.g. by adhesive.
5. If a layered product is characterised by the way it is produced and not by its structure or composition, the production method
should be classified in groups B32B 37/00 or B32B 38/00, or in subclass B29C, for example in groups B29C 45/16 or
• The classification of layered products is provided for in many classes, most of which are confined to a particular kind
of material. However, in order that this subclass may provide a basis for making a complete search with respect to layered
products, all relevant subject matter is classified in this subclass even though it may also be classified in other classes.
7. {In groups B32B 37/00,  B32B 38/00, B32B 41/00 and  B32B 39/00, the following expressions are used with the meaning
"lay-up" is considered to be the action of combining separate layers, one on top of the other, in order to form a half-
product for entering the laminating process
"laminating" means the action of combining previously unconnected but possibly laid up layers to become one product
whose layers will remain together;
"partial laminating" occurs when one layer does not fully cover a surface of another layer, whereby the layer with the
greater surface area is laminated on only part of its surface or when two coextensive layers are bonded on only part of
"adhesive" means a substance applied in any state or in any manner, which has bonding properties.}
8. {In this subclass, combination sets [C-Sets] are used. The detailed information about the  C-Sets construction and the
associated syntax rules are found in the definitions of B32B.}
