COMBINATION OR MULTI-PURPOSE TOOLS NOT OTHERWISE PROVIDED
FOR; DETAILS OR COMPONENTS OF PORTABLE POWER-DRIVEN TOOLS
NOT PARTICULARLY RELATED TO THE OPERATIONS PERFORMED AND NOT
OTHERWISE PROVIDED FOR {(machines or arrangements of machines for performing
specified combinations of different metal-working operations not covered by a single other
subclass B23P 23/00 and subgroups)}
This subclass does not cover tools having a clear primary function as well as one or more secondary functions. Those tools
are covered by the relevant subclass for tools having such primary function and are, thus, not classified in group B25F 1/00 or
    1/00    Combination or multi-purpose hand tools
