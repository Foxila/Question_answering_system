METAL-WORKING NOT OTHERWISE PROVIDED FOR; COMBINED
OPERATIONS; UNIVERSAL MACHINE TOOLS (arrangements for copying or controlling
• combinations of work-modifying operations covered by different subclasses of classes B21 - B24;
• combinations of metal-working operations with non-mechanical treatments of metal not provided for elsewhere, for
example in C21D, C22C, C22F or C23.
2. This subclass does not cover
• non-mechanical operations on non-metallic materials unless such operations are specially mentioned in this subclass;
• subsidiary operations performed in conjunction with main operations covered by a single subclass, e.g. assembling of parts
as an essential feature of a following metal-working operation, since they are not regarded as operations per se.
3. Attention is drawn to the Notes following the title of class B23.
