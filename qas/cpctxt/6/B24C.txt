COOPERATIVE PATENT CLASSIFICATION
PERFORMING OPERATIONS; TRANSPORTING
ABRASIVE OR RELATED BLASTING WITH PARTICULATE MATERIAL
• the use of a blast of any particles or pellets dispersed in air, gas, or liquid for the treatment of surfaces or cutting of
materials, the particles usually being of abrasive material;
• the equivalent use of a jet of particles or pellets projected or energised by means other than a stream of air
• {the equivalent use of material without particles or pellets for deburring, removal of extended surface areas or jet milling
of local recessions, e.g. grooves}
2. In this subclass, the following terms are used with the meanings indicated:
• "abrasive" covers any material used in the manner mentioned in Note (1) above;
• "blast" covers any equivalent jet of material mentioned in Note (1) above
In this subclass non-limiting references (in the sense of paragraph 39 of the Guide to the IPC) may still be displayed in the
