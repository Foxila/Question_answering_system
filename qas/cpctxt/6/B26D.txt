• cutting non-metallic sheet material and metal foil in general;
• cutting other forms of non-metallic material not otherwise provided for;
• features specific to machines for cutting, perforating, punching, cutting-out, stamping-out and severing by means other
than cutting, which relate to a requirement or problem of a nature which is not peculiar to a machine for these purposes,
that is, details of or arrangements for operating or controlling such machines, although the realisation of such features may
differ according to the kind of machine concerned. This subclass covers such features in general even if the feature in any
particular case is to some extent peculiar to, or is claimed only for, a machine designed for perforating, punching, cutting-
out, stamping-out, or for severing other than by cutting.
2. If the details or arrangements have no essential features specific to cutting, perforating, punching, cutting-out, stamping-out or
severing machines, the more general classes, e.g. F16, take precedence.
3. In this subclass, in groups B26D 5/00 and B26D 7/00, the following term is used with the meaning indicated:
• "cutting" includes cutting-out, stamping-out, punching, perforating, and severing by means other than cutting.
