2. In this subclass, the following terms or expressions are used with the meanings indicated:
• "controlling" means influencing a variable in any way,  e.g. changing its direction or its value (including changing it to or
from zero), maintaining it constant, limiting its range of variation;
• "regulation" means maintaining a variable automatically at a desired value or within a desired range of values. The desired
value or range may be fixed, or manually varied, or may vary with time according to a predetermined "programme" or
according to variation of another variable.  Regulation is a form of control;
• "automatic control" is often used in the art as a synonym for regulation.
• "Machine tool" means a mechanical working machine that removes material from a workpiece with a mechanical cutting
edge to perform a shaping operation, essentially through drilling, milling,  turning or cutting, e.g. sawing. The workpiece is
generally made of metal, wood or plastic and is not a human body, food or clothes.

In groups B23Q 33/00 or B23Q 35/00, the following term is used
• "copying" covers the derivation of a required shape from
a pattern, of the same or a different shape or scale, by a
mechanism or equivalent means controlled by a member
following the pattern. The pattern may be a model or drawing,
or an element such as a cam incorporated in the operating
mechanism of a machine. This term does not cover the
derivation of a required shape from simple geometrical shapes,
e.g. generating a cycloid by a rolling circle, which in general is
provided for in group B23Q 27/00
