In this subclass non-limiting references (in the sense of paragraph 39 of the Guide to the IPC) may still be displayed in the
    3/00    Impregnating wood, {e.g. impregnation
pretreatment, for example puncturing; Wood
impregnation aids not directly involved in the
impregnation process}(dyeing, staining B27K 5/00)
In groups B27K 3/16 - B27K 3/50, the last place
priority rule is applied, i.e. at each hierarchical
level, in the absence of an indication to the
contrary, impregnating agents are classified in the
last appropriate place.{This Note corresponds to
IPC Note (1) relating to B27K 3/16 - B27K 3/34.}
