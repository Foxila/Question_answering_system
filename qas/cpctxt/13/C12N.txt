1. Attention is drawn to Notes (1) to (3) following the title of class C12.
2. Biocidal, pest repellant, pest attractant or plant growth regulatory activity of compounds or preparations is further classified in
3. Therapeutic activity of single-cell proteins or enzymes is further classified in subclass A61P.
4. When classifying in this subclass, classification is also made in group B01D 15/08 insofar as subject matter of general interest
relating to chromatography is concerned.
5. In this subclass, it is desirable to add the indexing codes of subclass C12R.
6. {Documents relating to the use of vectors or hosts for the preparation of specific peptides, e.g. enzymes, are classified in
subclass C07K or in group C12N 9/00 according to the peptides, with the appropriate indexing codes.}
7. {In this subclass, combination sets [C-Sets] are used. The detailed information about the C-Sets construction and the
associated syntax rules is present in the definitions of C12N.}

signalling pathway and not by chemical structure,
e.g. the group of a protein covers not only peptide
analogs of it and the corresponding nucleic acids,
as in C07K 14/00, but also antibodies, anti-
idiotypic antibodies, non-peptide ligands of the
receptor, the receptor itself, antibodies against the
receptor or inhibitors of the conversion enzyme
which processes the protein precursor. Unless
