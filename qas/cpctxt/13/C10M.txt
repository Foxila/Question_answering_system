LUBRICATING COMPOSITIONS (well drilling compositions C09K 8/02); USE OF
CHEMICAL SUBSTANCES EITHER ALONE OR AS LUBRICATING INGREDIENTS
IN A LUBRICATING COMPOSITION ({lubricants for medical use A61} ; mould release,
i.e. separating, agents for metals B22C 3/00, for plastics or substances in a plastic state, in
general B29C 33/56, for glass C03B 40/02; use of particular substances in particular apparatus
or conditions, see F16N or the relevant groups for the application, e.g. A21D 8/08, B21C 9/00,
H01B 3/18; immersion oils for microscopy G02B 21/33)
1. In this subclass, the following terms are used with the meanings indicated:
• "lubricant" or "lubricating composition" includes cutting oils, hydraulic fluids, metal drawing compositions, flushing oils,
• "aliphatic" includes "cycloaliphatic".
2. In respect of the classification of mixtures, attention is drawn to Note (4) (e) below.
3. In this subclass, in the absence of an indication to the contrary, classification is made in the last appropriate place. Thus, a
compound having an aromatic ring is classified as aromatic regardless of whether the substituent(s) of interest are on the ring
or on an aliphatic part of the molecule.
a. metal or ammonium salts of a compound are classified as that compound;
b. salts or adducts formed between two or more organic compounds are classified according to all compounds forming the
salt or adduct, if of interest;
c. a specified compound, e.g. phenols, acids, substituted by a macromolecular hydrocarbon radical is classified as that
d. base-materials or thickeners or additives consisting of a mixture for which no specific main group is provided are classified
in the most indented group covering all essential constituents of the mixture, for example,
• a base-material mixture of ketone and amide - group C10M 105/00
• a base-material mixture of ketone and ether - group C10M 105/08
• an additive mixture of long and short chain esters - group C10M 129/00
• an additive mixture of short chain aliphatic and aromatic carboxylic acids- group C10M 129/26;
e. except for aqueous lubricating compositions containing more than 10% water, which are classified separately,
classification is made according to the type of ingredient or mixture of types of ingredient (base-material, thickener
or additive) which characterises the composition. Attention is drawn to the fact that a mixture of essential ingredients
characterised by only one of its components, rather than by the mixture as a whole, is not classified as a mixture, e.g. a
lubricating composition consisting of:
• a known base-material and a new additive is classified only in the "additive" part of the classification scheme;
• a known base-material with both a thickener and a further additive as essential ingredients, which may be individually
classified as a mixture of thickener and additive;
• known base-material with a combination of additives as essential ingredients, which may be individually known or not,
is classified in the appropriate place for the additive mixture.
5. In this subclass, it is desirable to add the indexing codes of:
• subclass C10M, relating to the chemical constitution of individual compounds of the lubricating compositions;
• subclass C10N, relating to physico-chemical aspects of the lubricating compositions or of their compounding ingredients.
For more information about the way of allocating these indexing codes, see the notes after the titles of the respective
6. In this subclass, until May 2003, indexing codes were added, relating to:
• each of the essential ingredients of a mixture. However, in the case of an aqueous lubricating composition covered by
group C10M 173/00, the presence of water is not indicated;
• each of the essential reactants of a reaction product covered by groups C10M 109/02, C10M 121/04 or C10M 159/12
The indexing codes, which are chosen from groups  C10M 101/00 - C10M 109/00, C10M 113/00 - C10M 121/00,
C10M 125/00 - C10M 139/00, C10M 143/00 - C10M 155/00, C10M 159/00 or C10M 163/00 - C10M 167/00, were given
7. In this subclass, until May 2003, the indexing codes of subclass C10N were added.
Documents classified with Combination Sets according to internal Notes 2), 3) and 5) are in the state of being reclassified
1. The following groups are no longer used for the classification of new documents from January, 1978:
The backlog of these groups is continuously being reclassified in groups C10M 101/00 - C10M 177/00.
