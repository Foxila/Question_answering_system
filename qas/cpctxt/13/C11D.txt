1. When classifying in the mixture groups of this subclass, any individual ingredient of a composition which is not identified
by such classification, and which itself is determined to be novel and non-obvious, must also be classified in groups
C11D 1/00 - C11D 9/00. The individual ingredient can be either a single substance or a composition in itself.
2. Any ingredient of a composition which is not identified by the classification according to Note (1) above, and which is
considered to represent information of interest for search, may also be classified in groups C11D 1/00 - C11D 9/00. This
can, for example, be the case when it is considered of interest to enable searching of compositions using a combination of
classification symbols. Such non-obligatory classification should be given as "additional information".
3. {Documents classified in groups C11D 1/37, C11D 1/645 - C11D 1/655, C11D 1/825 - C11D 1/86, C11D 1/94 - C11D 1/945
and C11D 10/00 - C11D 10/047, are indexed using codes chosen from C11D 1/00 - C11D 1/92 to provide information on the
individual ingredients on the compositions.}
