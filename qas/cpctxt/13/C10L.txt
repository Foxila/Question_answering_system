{In subclass C10L it is desirable to give indexing codes for information about components of solid, liquid and gaseous
fuels or firelighters, their additives and constituents and their preparation and use. The indexing codes are taken from
In this subclass non-limiting references (in the sense of paragraph 39 of the Guide to the IPC) may still be displayed in the

1. In groups C10L 1/12 - C10L 1/14, the last place
priority rule is applied, i.e. at each hierarchical
level, in the absence of an indication to the
contrary, a compound is classified in the last
{This Note corresponds to IPC Note (1) relating to
2. If an additive is a mixture of compounds,
classification is made for each compound of
interest. {This Note corresponds to IPC Note (2)
relating to C10L 1/12 - C10L 1/14.}
3. A metal salt or an ammonium salt of a compound
is classified as that compound, e.g. a chromium
sulfonate is classified as a sulfonate in group
C10L 1/24 and not in group C10L 1/30.
{This Note corresponds to IPC Note (3) relating to
4. {When classifying in this group, it is desirable
to classify the individual additional components
using Combination Sets with symbols chosen from
groups C10L 1/12 - C10L 1/308.}
5. {Mixtures of additives are classified in the
corresponding main group. Individual additives
can be classified using Combination Sets

additive are mentioned, e.g. as a Markush-formula,
classification may be done in the corresponding
main group only, the alternatives being classified
using Combination Sets, according to the Note
