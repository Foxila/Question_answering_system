1. This subclass covers the production of compounds or compositions by biochemical transformation of matter performed by
using enzymes or microorganisms, wherein microorganisms are defined as any single-celled organisms, including bacteria,
fungi, yeast or microalgae, or plant or mammalian cells in the form of cell cultures.

classification according to the method or biocatalyst used to produce the compound is made.
