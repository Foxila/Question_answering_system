   10/00    Geothermal collectors
   10/10    . with circulation of working fluids through
underground channels, the working fluids not
coming into direct contact with the ground
   10/13    . . using tube assemblies suitable for insertion into
boreholes in the ground, e.g. geothermal probes
   10/15    . . . using bent tubes; using tubes assembled with
connectors or with return headers
   10/17    . . . using tubes closed at one end, i.e. return-type
   10/20    . using underground water as working fluid; using
working fluid injected directly into the ground, e.g.
using injection wells and recovery wells
   10/30    . using underground reservoirs for accumulating
working fluids or intermediate fluids
   10/40    . operated without external energy sources, e.g. using
thermosiphonic circulation or heat pipes
