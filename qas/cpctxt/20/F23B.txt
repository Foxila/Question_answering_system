COMBUSTION APPARATUS; COMBUSTION PROCESSES
METHODS OR APPARATUS FOR COMBUSTION USING ONLY SOLID FUEL (for
combustion of fuels that are solid at room temperatures, but burned in melted form, e.g. candle
wax, C11C 5/00, F23C, F23D; using solid fuel suspended in air F23C, F23D 1/00; using solid
fuel suspended in liquids F23C, F23D 11/00; using solid fuel and fluent fuel simultaneously
or alternately F23C, F23D 17/00; burning of low grade fuel F23G; grates F23H; feeding solid
fuel to combustion apparatus F23K; combustion chambers, not otherwise provided for F23M;
domestic apparatus F24; central heating boilers F24D; package boilers F24H)
1. This subclass only covers combustion wherein the main body of fuel is either essentially stationary during combustion or
mechanically transported, as opposed to pneumatically transported or suspended in air, during combustion.
2. In this subclass, the first place priority rule is applied, i.e. at each hierarchical level, in the absence of an indication to the
contrary, classification is made in the first appropriate place.
3. In this subclass, methods are classified in the groups that cover the apparatus used. Methods that are not related to a particular
type of apparatus are classified in group F23B 90/00.
4. In this subclass, it is desirable to add the indexing codes of groups F23B 2101/00 - F23B 2900/00.
In this subclass non-limiting references (in the sense of paragraph 39 of the Guide to the IPC) may still be displayed in the
