1. This subclass covers treatment, e.g. purification, of air supplied to human living or working spaces in air conditioning systems
• air-humidification as auxiliary treatment in air-conditioning, i.e. in units wherein the air is also either cooled or heated, is
covered by groups F24F 1/00 or F24F 3/14;
• air-humidification per se, e.g. "room humidifiers", is covered by group F24F 6/00.
3. In this subclass, the following terms or expressions are used with the meanings indicated:
• "air-conditioning" means the supply of air to or the treatment of air in rooms or spaces by means of cooling or a
combination of cooling and a further kind of air treatment, e.g. humidification, heating or air purification;
• "ventilation" means the supply of air to, or its extraction from, rooms or spaces, and systems for circulating air within
rooms or spaces, but does not cover the mere treatment of air being supplied to, extracted from, or circulated within, rooms
4. In this subclass, control or safety arrangements are classified in group F24F 11/00. In order to indicate the type of air-
treatment system in which these arrangements are used, further classification may be made in groups F24F 1/00 - F24F 9/00.
