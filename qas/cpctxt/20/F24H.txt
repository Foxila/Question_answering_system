FLUID HEATERS, e.g. WATER OR AIR HEATERS, HAVING HEAT-GENERATING
MEANS, e.g. HEAT PUMPS, IN GENERAL (steam generation F22)
1. The distinguishing feature of the air heaters covered by this subclass is that the heat is predominantly released to the air by
convection, mostly by forced circulation of the air. The domestic stoves or ranges covered by subclasses F24B, F24C may
also be fired or electric air heaters but they release their heat to a considerable extent by radiation and only to some extent by
2. In this subclass, the following terms are used with the meanings indicated:
• "water" includes other liquids and means always the liquid to be heated;
• "air" includes other gases or gas mixtures and means always the gas to be heated;
• "furnace tubes" means tubes inside the heater wherein combustion is performed;
• "fire tubes" means tubes inside the heater through which flue-gases flow from a combustion chamber located outside the
• "heater" means apparatus including both heat generating means and means for transferring the generated heat to water or
3. All storage heaters are classified in group F24H 7/00.
