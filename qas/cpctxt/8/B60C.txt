1. In this subclass, the term "tyre" is to be understood as a separate ground-engaging, continuous element outside the periphery
of the wheel rim and includes the tyre casing, cover, or jacket and any insert, e.g. inner tube. In the groups relating to repair or
connection of valves, the term "tyre" is to be understood to include also inflatable elastic bodies other than tyres or inner tubes
