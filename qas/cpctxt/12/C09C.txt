2. Treatment by polymerisation onto particle is classified in C08F 292/00. Only treatment by already polymerised agents is
3. Whenever in groups C09C 1/00 - C09C 1/66 the materials consist of a particulate core bearing a coating or any other deposit,
classification is done only according to the composition of the core, unless otherwise stated, e.g. C09C 1/0015, C09C 1/0078
4. Preparations of those materials which are no single chemical compounds comprise those of many ceramic pigments
(C09C 1/0009), consisting of solid solutions or polycristalline structures, and those defined as composite materials
5. Preparation and treatment steps are not always easy to distinguish from each other, e.g. preparation in the presence of treating
agents (by precipitation or calcination), precise reacting conditions, affecting pigmentary effects. It is common practice to
include these complex topics in C09C 1/00 while avoiding redundancy

1. {The optical properties of the interference
pigments are depending on the order of the
different layers applied on the substrate in view
of their refractive indices; A refractive index <
or = 1.8 is considered low, a refractive index
>1.8 is considered high; A dye is always an
organic, coloured material. An aluminium lake
compound would for classification purposes also
fall under this definition, as well as any coloured
metal chelate or metal complex with organic
ligands; An interference pigment can e.g. have
a flaky, spherical or ellipsoidal core; A pigment
comprising a core consisting of a metal is only
considered as an interference pigment if it shows
properties typical for interference pigments}
