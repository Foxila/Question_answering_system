COOPERATIVE PATENT CLASSIFICATION
ORGANIC MACROMOLECULAR COMPOUNDS; THEIR PREPARATION OR
CHEMICAL WORKING-UP; COMPOSITIONS BASED THEREON
MACROMOLECULAR COMPOUNDS OBTAINED OTHERWISE THAN BY
REACTIONS ONLY INVOLVING UNSATURATED CARBON-TO-CARBON BONDS
1. Therapeutic activity of compounds is further classified in subclass A61P.
2. In this subclass, group C08G 18/00 takes precedence over the other groups. A further classification is given if the polymers
are obtained by reactions forming specific linkages for which an appropriate group is provided.
3. Within each main group of this subclass, the last place priority rule is applied, i.e. at each hierarchical level, in the absence of
an indication to the contrary, classification is made in the last appropriate place.
4. This subclass covers also compositions based on monomers which form macromolecular compounds classifiable in this
a. if the monomers are defined, classification is made in groups C08G 2/00 - C08G 79/00, C08G 83/00 according to the
b. if the monomers are defined in a way that a composition cannot be classified within one main group of this subclass, the
composition is classified in group C08G 85/00;
c. if the compounding ingredients are of interest per se, classification is also made in subclass C08K.
5. {In this subclass, combination sets [C-Sets] are used. The detailed information about the C-Sets construction and the
associated syntax rules are found in the Definitions}
