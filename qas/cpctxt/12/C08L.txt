1. In this subclass, the following term is used with the meaning indicated:
a. natural or conjugated diene rubbers;
b. rubber in general (for a specific rubber, other than a natural rubber or a conjugated diene rubber, see the group provided
for compositions of such macromolecular compounds).
a. compositions are classified according to the mutual proportions by weight of only the macromolecular constituents;
b. compositions are classified according to the macromolecular constituent or constituents present in the highest proportion: if
all these constituents are present in equal proportions the composition is classified according to each of these constituents.
3. Any macromolecular constituent of a composition which is not identified by the classification according to Note (2) above,
and the use of which is determined to be novel and non-obvious, must also be classified in this subclass. For example, a
composition containing 80 parts polyethene and 20 parts polyvinyl chloride is classified in both groups C08L 23/06 and
C08L 27/06, if the use of polyvinyl chloride is determined to be novel and non-obvious. {This IPC Note does not apply in
4. Any macromolecular constituent of a composition which is not identified by the classification according to Notes (2) or (3)
above, and which is considered to represent information of interest for search, may also be classified in this subclass. This
can, for example, be the case when it is considered of interest to enable searching of compositions using a combination of
classification symbols. Such non-obligatory classification should be given as "additional information". {This IPC Note does
5. In groups C08L 65/00 - C08L 85/00, in the absence of an indication to the contrary, compositions of macromolecular
compounds obtained by reactions forming two different linkages in the main chain are classified only according to the linkage
present in excess.{This Note corresponds to IPC Note (1) relating to C08L 65/00 - C08L 85/00.}
6. {Compositions classified in C08K according to note 3 of C08K, are not classified in C08L.}
7. {In this subclass, combination sets [C-Sets] are used. The detailed information about the C-Sets construction and the
associated syntax rules is present in the definitions of C08L}
