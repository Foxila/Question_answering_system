COOPERATIVE PATENT CLASSIFICATION
This subclass covers compounds containing a cyclopenta[a]hydrophenanthrene skeleton or a ring structure derived therefrom:
• by contraction or expansion of one ring by one or two atoms;
• by contraction or expansion of two rings each by one atom;
• by contraction of one ring by one atom and expansion of one ring by one atom;
• by substitution of one or two carbon atoms of the cyclopenta[a]hydrophenanthrene skeleton,  which are not shared by
rings, by hetero atoms, in combination with the above defined  contraction or expansion or not, or;
• by condensation with carbocyclic or heterocyclic rings in combination with one or more of the  foregoing alterations or
In this subclass non-limiting references (in the sense of paragraph 39 of the Guide to the IPC) may still be displayed in the
