COOPERATIVE PATENT CLASSIFICATION
ORGANIC MACROMOLECULAR COMPOUNDS; THEIR PREPARATION OR
CHEMICAL WORKING-UP; COMPOSITIONS BASED THEREON
MACROMOLECULAR COMPOUNDS OBTAINED BY REACTIONS ONLY
INVOLVING CARBON-TO-CARBON UNSATURATED BONDS
1. In this subclass, boron or silicon are considered as metals.
2. In this subclass, the following expression is used with the meaning indicated:
• "aliphatic radical" means an acyclic or a non-aromatic carbocyclic carbon skeleton which is considered to be terminated by
a. an element other than carbon;
b. a carbon atom having a double bond to one atom other than carbon;
c. an aromatic carbocyclic ring or a heterocyclic ring.
a. CH2 =CH—O—CH2—CH2—NH—COO—CH2-CH2 —OH are classified in group C08F 16/28;
b. CH2=CH-C(=O)-CH=CH2 are classified in group  C08F 16/36
c. para-C6H4Cl(CH=CH2) are classified in group  C08F 12/18.
3. Therapeutic activity of compounds is further classified in subclass A61P.
4. In this subclass, in the absence of an indication to the contrary in the scheme or definitions, classification is made in the last
a. macromolecular compounds and their preparation are classified in the groups for the type of compound prepared. General
processes for the preparation of macromolecular compounds according to more than one main group are classified in
groups C08F 2/00-C08F 8/00 for the processes employed. Processes for the preparation of macromolecular compounds are
also classified in the groups for the types of reactions employed, if of interest;
b. subject matter relating to both homopolymers and copolymers is classified in groups C08F 10/00-C08F 38/00;
c. subject matter limited to homopolymers is classified only in groups C08F 110/00-C08F 138/00;
d. subject matter limited to copolymers is classified only in groups C08F 210/00-C08F 246/00;
e. in groups C08F 210/00-C08F 238/00, in the absence of an indication to the contrary, a copolymer is classified according to
6. This subclass covers  also compositions based on monomers which form macromolecular compounds classifiable in this
a. if the monomers are defined, classification is made according to the polymer to be formed:
• in groups C08F 10/00-C08F 246/00 if no preformed polymer is present;
• in groups C08F 251/00 - C08F 291/00 if a preformed polymer is present, considering {or not} the reaction to take place
as a graft or cross-linking reaction;
b. if the presence of compounding ingredients is of interest, classification is made in group C08F 2/44
c. if the compounding ingredients are of interest  per se , classification is also made in subclass  C08K.
