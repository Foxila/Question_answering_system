COOPERATIVE PATENT CLASSIFICATION
HETEROCYCLIC COMPOUNDS (macromolecular compounds C08)
1. This subclass does not cover compounds containing saccharide radicals as defined in Note (3) following the title of subclass
C07H, which are covered by subclass C07H.
2. In this subclass, in compounds containing a hetero ring covered by group C07D 295/00 and at least one other hetero ring, the
hetero ring covered by group C07D 295/00 is considered as an acyclic chain containing nitrogen atoms.
3. In this subclass, the following terms or expressions are used with the meaning indicated:
• "hetero ring" is a ring having at least one halogen, nitrogen, oxygen, sulfur, selenium or tellurium atom as a ring member;
• "bridged" means the presence of at least one fusion other than ortho, peri or spiro;
• two rings are "condensed" if they share at least one ring member, i.e. "spiro" and "bridged" are considered as condensed;
• "condensed ring system" is a ring system in which all rings are condensed among themselves;
• "number of relevant rings" in a condensed ring system equals the number of scissions necessary to convert the ring system
• "relevant rings" in a condensed ring system, i.e. the rings which taken together describe all the links between every atom of
the ring system, are chosen according to the following criteria consecutively:
a. lowest number of ring members;
b. highest number of hetero atoms as ring members;
c. lowest number of members shared with other rings;
d. last place in the classification scheme.
4. Attention is drawn to Note (3) after class C07, which defines the last place priority rule applied in the range of subclasses
C07C - C07K and within these subclasses.
5. Therapeutic activity of compounds is further classified in subclass A61P.
6. In this subclass, the last place priority rule is applied, i.e. at each hierarchical level, in the absence of an indication to the
a. compounds having only one hetero ring are classified in the last appropriate place in one of the groups
C07D 203/00 - C07D 347/00. The same applies for compounds having more hetero rings covered by the same main group,
neither condensed among themselves nor condensed with a common carbocyclic ring system;
b. compounds having two or more hetero rings covered by different main groups neither condensed among themselves
nor condensed with a common carbocyclic ring system are classified in the last appropriate place in one of the groups
c. compounds having two or more relevant hetero rings, covered by the same or by different main groups, which are
condensed among themselves or condensed with a common carbocyclic ring system, are classified in the last appropriate
place in one of the groups C07D 451/00 - C07D 519/00.
• where a compound may exist in tautomeric forms, it is classified as though existing in the form which is classified last
in the system. Therefore, double bonds between ring members and non-ring members and double bonds between ring
members themselves are considered equivalent in determining the degree of hydrogenation of the ring. Formulae are
considered to be written in Kekule form;
• hydrocarbon radicals containing a carbocyclic ring and an acyclic chain by which it is linked to the hetero ring and being
substituted on both the carbocyclic ring and the acyclic chain by hetero atoms or by carbon atoms having three bonds to
hetero atoms with at the most one bond to halogen, are classified according to the substituents on the acyclic chain. For
is classified in group C07D 233/22,
1Heterocyclic compounds having only nitrogen as ring hetero atom
is classified in groups C07D 233/24 and C07D 233/26, where X —NH2, —NHCOCH3, or —COOCH3.
