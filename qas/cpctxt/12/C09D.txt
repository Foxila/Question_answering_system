1. In this subclass, the following terms or expressions are used with the meanings indicated:
• "use of materials for coating compositions" means the use of known or new polymers or products;
a. natural or conjugated diene rubbers;
b. rubber in general (for a specific rubber, other than a natural rubber or a conjugated diene rubber, see the group provided
for coating compositions based on such macromolecular compounds);
• "based on" is defined by means of Note (3), below;
• "filling pastes" means materials used to fill up the holes or cavities of a substrate in order to smooth its surface prior
2. In this subclass, coating compositions, containing specific organic macromolecular substances are classified only according to
the macromolecular substance, non-macromolecular substances not being taken into account.
Example: a coating composition containing polyethene and amino-propyltrimethoxysilane is classified in group
However, coating compositions containing combinations of organic non-macromolecular compounds having at least
one polymerisable carbon-to-carbon unsaturated bond with prepolymers or polymers other than unsaturated polymers of
groups C09D 159/00 - C09D 187/00 are classified according to the unsaturated non-macromolecular component in group
Example: a coating composition containing polyethene and styrene monomer is classified in group C09D 4/00.
Aspects relating to the physical nature of the coating compositions or to the effects produced, as defined in group
C09D 5/00, if clearly and explicitly stated, are also classified in this subclass.
Coating compositions characterised by other features, e.g. additives, are classified in group C09D 7/00, unless the
macromolecular constituent is specified.
3. In this subclass, coating compositions comprising two or more macromolecular constituents are classified according to the
macromolecular constituent or constituents present in the highest proportion, i.e. the constituent on which the composition
is based. If the composition is based on two or more constituents, present in equal proportions, the composition is classified
according to each of these constituents.
Example: a coating composition containing 80 parts of polyethene and 20 parts of polyvinylchloride is classified in group
C09D 123/06. A coating composition containing 40 parts of polyethene and 40 parts of polyvinylchloride is classified in
groups C09D 123/06 and C09D 127/06.
4. In groups C09D 101/00 - C09D 201/00, any macromolecular constituent of a coating composition which is not identified by
the classification according to Note (3) after the title of subclass C09D, and the use of which is determined to be novel and
non-obvious, must also be classified in a group chosen from groups C09D 101/00 - C09D 201/00.
{This Note corresponds to IPC Note (1) relating to C09D 101/00 - C09D 201/00.}
5. Any macromolecular constituent of a coating composition which is not identified by the classification according to Note (3)
after the title of subclass C09D or Note (1) above, and which is considered to represent information of interest for search,
may also be classified in a group chosen from groups C09D 101/00 - C09D 201/00. This can for example be the case when
it is considered of interest to enable searching of coating compositions using a combination of classification symbols. Such
non-obligatory classification should be given as "additional information." {This Note corresponds to IPC Note (2) relating to
6. In groups C09D 165/00 - C09D 185/00, in the absence of an indication to the contrary, coating compositions based on
macromolecular compounds obtained by reactions forming two different linkages in the main chain are classified only
according to the linkage present in excess.
{This Note corresponds to IPC Note (1) relating to C09D 165/00 - C09D 185/00.}

syntax rules is found in the definitions for C09D.}
