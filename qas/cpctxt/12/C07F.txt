ELEMENTS OTHER THAN CARBON, HYDROGEN, HALOGEN, OXYGEN,
NITROGEN, SULFUR, SELENIUM OR TELLURIUM (metal-containing porphyrins
1. Attention is drawn to Note (3) C07, which defines the last place priority rule applied in the range of subclasses C07C-C07K
2. Attention is drawn to Note (6) following the title of class C07.
3. Attention is drawn to Note (3) after the title of section C, which Note indicates to which version of the periodic table of
chemical elements the IPC refers.
4. In this subclass , organic acid salts, alcoholates, phenates, chelates or mercaptides are classified as the parent compounds.
5. Compounds containing Se or Te are classified with their sulfur homologues
6. A hydrocarbon chain is considered to be terminated by a heteroatom or by a carbon atom having three bonds to heteroatoms
with at the most one to halogen
7. When groups, e.g. aromatic or aliphatic groups, are mentioned without further indications, it means that the group concerned
can be further substituted. Otherwise it will be indicated, e.g. C07F 9/11 with hydroxyalkyl compounds without further
