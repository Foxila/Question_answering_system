1. This subclass covers compounds containing saccharide radicals (see the definitions in Note (3) below).
2. This subclass does not cover polysaccharides which for the purpose of this subclass are defined as having more than five
saccharide radicals attached to each other by glycosidic linkages.
3. In this subclass, the following expressions are used with the meanings indicated:
• "saccharide radical" which is derived from acyclic polyhydroxy-aldehydes or acyclic polyhydroxy-ketones, or from their
cyclic tautomers, by removing hydrogen atoms or by replacing hetero bonds to oxygen by the same number of hetero
bonds to halogen, nitrogen, sulfur, selenium, or tellurium, in accordance with either of the following definitions:
i. consists of an uninterrupted carbon skeleton and oxygen atoms directly attached thereto, and
ii. is considered to be terminated by every bond to a carbon atom of a cyclic structure and by every bond to a carbon
atom having three bonds to hetero atoms, e.g. ester or nitrile radicals, and
iii. contains within the carbon skeleton an unbranched sequence of at the most six carbon atoms in which at least three
carbon atoms — at least two in the case of a skeleton having only four carbon atoms — have one single bond to an
oxygen atom as the only hetero bond, and
A. in a cyclic or acyclic sequence, at least one other carbon atom has two single bonds to oxygen atoms as the only
B. in an acyclic sequence, at least one other carbon atom has one double bond to an oxygen atom as the only hetero
bond, the said sequence containing at the most one double bond, i.e. C=C or possibly ketalised C=O), in addition
to the hetero bonds mentioned above under (A) or (B), e.g. the compounds 
of at the most six carbon atoms, having bonds to oxygen as defined in this Note 
n being an integer, are classified in group C07H 3/02;
b. It is also a radical derived from a radical as defined in (a) above by replacing at the most four of the specified hetero
bonds to oxygen by the same number of hetero bonds to halogen, nitrogen, sulfur, selenium, or tellurium;
• "heterocyclic radical" or "hetero ring" is considered to exclude saccharide radicals as defined above
4. Attention is drawn to Note (3) after class C07, which defines the last place priority rule applied in the range of subclasses
C07C-C07K and within these subclasses.
