1. In this subclass, the following terms or expressions are used with the meanings indicated:
• "use of materials as adhesives" means the use of known or new polymers or products;
a. natural or conjugated diene rubbers;
b. rubber in general (for a specific rubber, other than a natural rubber or a conjugated diene rubber, see the group provided
for adhesives based on such macromolecular compounds);
• "based on" is defined by means of Note (3), below.
2. In this subclass, adhesives containing specific macromolecular substances are classified only according to the macromolecular
substance, non-macromolecular substances not being taken into account.
• Example: an adhesive containing polyethene and amino-propyltrimethoxysilane is classified in group C09J 123/06.
• However, adhesives containing combinations of organic non-macromolecular compounds having at least one
polymerisable carbon-to-carbon unsaturated bond with prepolymers or polymers other than unsaturated polymers of
groups C09J 159/00 - C09J 187/00 are classified according to the unsaturated non-macromolecular component in group
• Example: an adhesive containing polyethene and styrene monomer is classified in group C09J 4/06.
• Aspects relating to the physical nature of the adhesives or to the effects produced, as defined in group C09J 9/00, if clearly
and explicitly stated, are also classified in this subclass.
• Adhesives characterised by other features, e.g. additives, are classified in group C09J 11/00, unless the macromolecular
3. In this subclass, adhesives comprising two or more macromolecular constituents are classified according to the
macromolecular constituent or constituents present in the highest proportion, i.e. the constituent on which the adhesive is
based. If the adhesive is based on two or more constituents, present in equal proportions, the adhesive is classified according
• Example: An adhesive containing 80 parts of polyethene and 20 parts of polyvinylchloride is classified in group
C09J 123/06. An adhesive containing 40 parts of polyethene and 40 parts of polyvinylchloride is classified in groups
4. {In groups C09J 101/00 - C09J 201/00, any macromolecular constituent of an adhesive composition which is not identified
by the classification according to Note (3) after the title of subclass C09J, and the use of which is determined to be novel and
non-obvious, must also be classified in a group chosen from groups C09J 101/00 - C09J 201/00. This Note corresponds to IPC
Note (1) relating to C09J 101/00 - C09J 201/00.}
5. {Any macromolecular constituent of an adhesive composition which is not identified by the classification according to Note
(3) after the title of subclass C09J or Note (4) above, and which is considered to represent information of interest for search,
may also be classified in a group chosen from groups C09J 101/00 - C09J 201/00. This can, for example, be the case when
it is considered of interest to enable searching of adhesive compositions using a combination of classification symbols. Such
non-obligatory classification should be given as "additional information". This Note corresponds to IPC Note (2) relating to
6. {In groups C09J 165/00 - C09J 185/00, in the absence of an indication to the contrary, adhesives based on macromolecular
compounds obtained by reactions forming two different linkages in the main chain are classified only according to the linkage
This Note corresponds to IPC Note (1) relating to C09J 165/00 - C09J 185/00.}

8. {In this subclass, combination sets [C-Sets] are used. The detailed information about the C-Sets construction and the
associated syntax rules are found in the Definitions of C09J.}

(see also C-Sets search rules in C08L, C09D and in the C09J definition).}
