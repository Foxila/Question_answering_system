COOPERATIVE PATENT CLASSIFICATION
GENERAL METHODS OF ORGANIC CHEMISTRY; APPARATUS THEREFOR
(preparation of carboxylic acid esters by telomerisation C07C 67/47; telomerisation C08F)
1. In this subclass, the functional group which is present already in some residue being introduced and is not substantially
involved in a chemical reaction, is not considered as the functional group which is formed or introduced as a result of the
2. In this subclass, the following term is used with the meaning indicated:
â€¢ "separation" means separation only for the purposes of recovering organic compounds.
3. When classifying in this subclass, classification is also made in group B01D 15/08 insofar as subject matter of general interest
relating to chromatography is concerned
4. In this subclass, the last place priority rule is applied, i.e. at each hierarchical level, in the absence of an indication to the
contrary, classification is made in the last appropriate place according to the type of reaction employed, noting the bond or the
functional group which is formed or introduced as a result of the chemical reaction.
5. {C07B 59/00 and subgroups thereof are used for the classification of individual labelled compounds as well as for general
6. {C07B 61/02 is used for the classification of individual free radicals as well as for general methods.}
