COOPERATIVE PATENT CLASSIFICATION
ACYCLIC OR CARBOCYCLIC COMPOUNDS
1. In this subclass, the following terms or expressions are used with meanings indicated:
• "bridged" means the presence of at least one fusion other than ortho, peri or spiro;
• two rings are "condensed" if they share at least one ring member, i.e. "spiro" and "bridged" are considered as condensed;
• "condensed ring system" is a ring system in which all rings are condensed among themselves;
• "number of rings" in a condensed ring system equals the number of scissions necessary to convert the ring system into one
• "quinones" are compounds derived from compounds containing a six-membered aromatic ring or a system comprising six-
membered aromatic rings (which system may be condensed or not condensed) by replacing two or four CH groups of the
six-membered aromatic rings by C=O groups, and by removing one or two carbon-to-carbon double bonds, respectively,
and rearranging the remaining carbon-to-carbon double bonds to give a ring or ring system with alternating double bonds,
including the carbon-to-oxygen bonds; this means that acenaphthenequinone or camphorquinone are not considered as
2. In this subclass, in the absence of an indication to the contrary, a process is classified in the last appropriate place.
3. In this subclass, in the absence of an indication to the contrary, "quaternary ammonium compounds" are classified with the
corresponding "non-quaternised nitrogen compounds".
4. For the classification of compounds in groups C07C 1/00 - C07C 71/00 and C07C 401/00 - C07C 409/00 :
• a compound is classified considering the molecule as a whole (rule of the "whole molecule approach");
• a compound is considered to be saturated if it does not contain carbon atoms bound  to each other by multiple bonds;
• a compound is considered to be unsaturated if it contains carbon atoms bound to  each other by multiple bonds, which
includes six-membered aromatic ring, unless   otherwise specified or implicitely derivable from the subdivision.
5. For the classification of compounds in groups C07C 201/00 - C07C 395/00, i.e. after the functional group has been
determined according to the"last place rule", a compound is classified according to the following principles:
• compounds are classified in accordance with the nature of the carbon atom to which the functional group is attached;
• a carbon skeleton is a carbon atom, other than a carbon atom of a carboxyl group,  or a chain of carbon atoms bound to
each other, a carbon skeleton is considered to be terminated by every bond to an element other than carbon or to a carbon
• when the molecule contains several functional groups, only functional groups linked  to the same carbon skeleton as the
one first determined are considered;
• a carbon sekeleton is considered to be saturated if it does not contain carbon atoms bound to each other by multiple bonds;
• a carbon skeleton is considered to be unsaturated if it contains carbon atoms bound  to each other by multiple bonds, which
includes a six-membered aromatic ring.
6. When classifying in this subclass, classification is also made in group B01D 15/08 insofar as subject matter of general interest
relating to chromatography is concerned.
7. When a process is classified in a process group, combination sets are used to indicate the product of the process. A
combination set consists of a process group, followed by and linked to the group of the product. The products are selected
from the corresponding product groups.
