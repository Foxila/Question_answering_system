COOPERATIVE PATENT CLASSIFICATION
ORGANIC MACROMOLECULAR COMPOUNDS; THEIR PREPARATION OR
CHEMICAL WORKING-UP; COMPOSITIONS BASED THEREON
Use of inorganic or non-macromolecular organic substances as compounding ingredients
(paints, inks, varnishes, dyes, polishes, adhesives C09)
1. In this subclass, in the absence of an indication to the contrary, an ingredient is classified in the last appropriate place.
• a mixture of ingredients is classified in the most indented group covering all the essential ingredients of the mixture, e.g.:
a mixture of a monohydric and a polyhydric alcohol C08K 5/05
a mixture of two polyhydric alcohols C08K 5/053
a mixture of an alcohol and an ether C08K 5/04
a mixture of an ether and an amine C08K 5/00
a mixture of an amine and a metal C08K 13/02
{This note is applied only for mixtures with more than three essential ingredients. Mixtures with two or three
ingredients are classified in the appropriate groups of C08K, e.g. a mixture of Al2O3, an ether and an amine is
classified in C08K 3/22, C08K 5/06 and C08K 5/17}
• ammonium salts are classified in the same way as metal salts
3. In this subclass, any ingredient of a mixture which is not identified by the classification according to Note (2) above, and the
use of which is determined to be novel and non-obvious, must also be classified in this subclass according to Note (1). The
ingredient can be either a single compound or a composition in itself. ".{This IPC Note does not apply in CPC}
4. Any ingredient of a mixture which is not identified by the classification according to Notes (2) or (3) above, and which
is considered to represent information of interest for search, may also be classified in this subclass according to Note (1).
This can, for example, be the case when it is considered of interest to enable searching of mixtures using a combination of
classification symbols. Such non-obligatory classification should be given as "additional information".{This IPC Note does
