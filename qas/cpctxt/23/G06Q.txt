1. Groups G06Q 10/00 - G06Q 50/00 and G06Q 99/00 only cover systems or methods that involve significant data processing
operations, i.e. data processing operations that need to be carried out by a technological, e.g. computing, system or device.
Group G06Q 90/00 covers systems or methods that do not involve significant data processing, when both of the following
• the systems or methods are specially adapted for the purposes mentioned in the subclass title or the titles of groups
• the systems or methods cannot be classified elsewhere, for example by applying the principles described in paragraph 96 of
2. When classifying such systems or methods in group G06Q 90/00, additional classification may be made in the most closely
related group of this or any other subclass, if this classification gives information about the application of the systems or
methods that could be of interest for search. Such non-obligatory classification must be given as "additional information".
1. G06Q has been largely refined to bring most of the former USPC 705 groups into ECLA, prior to CPC launch. Therefore,
most of the new G06Q subdivisions are not complete pending reclassification. Users are invited to systematically consult
also the hierarchically higher groups, up to the first valid IPC group. For example, while searching in G06Q 50/2053, it is
appropriate to consult also G06Q 50/205 and G06Q 50/20
2. In this subclass non-limiting references (in the sense of paragraph 39 of the Guide to the IPC) may still be displayed in the
