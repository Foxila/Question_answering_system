COOPERATIVE PATENT CLASSIFICATION
HANDLING OF COINS OR VALUABLE PAPERS, e.g. TESTING, SORTING BY
DENOMINATIONS, COUNTING, DISPENSING, CHANGING OR DEPOSITING
In this subclass, the following terms or expressions are used with the meaning indicated:
• "coins" also covers tokens of similar nature;
• "valuable papers" covers paper currency, banknotes, bills, cheques, vouchers, securities, bonds or similar valuable papers,
irrespective of the material used for these, which represent monetary value that can be measured or verified.
In this subclass non-limiting references (in the sense of paragraph 39 of the Guide to the IPC) may still be displayed in the
