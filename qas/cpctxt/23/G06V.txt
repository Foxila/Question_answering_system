• methods or arrangements for pattern recognition or machine learning specially adapted for images or video.
2. In this subclass, the following terms or expressions are used with the meaning indicated:
• "pattern recognition" means detection, categorisation, authentication and identification of patterns for explanatory purposes
or to derive a certain meaning in images or video, by acquiring, preprocessing or extracting distinctive features and
matching, clustering or classifying these features or representations thereof;
• "feature extraction" means deriving descriptive or quantitative measures from images or video;
• "clustering" means grouping or separating patterns according to their (dis)similarity or closeness;
• "classification" means the identification of an object/feature as belonging to a class of objects/features by assigning of a
