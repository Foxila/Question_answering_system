COOPERATIVE PATENT CLASSIFICATION
CONTROL OR REGULATING SYSTEMS IN GENERAL; FUNCTIONAL ELEMENTS
OF SUCH SYSTEMS; MONITORING OR TESTING ARRANGEMENTS FOR SUCH
SYSTEMS OR ELEMENTS (fluid-pressure actuators or systems acting by means of fluids in
general F15B; valves per se F16K; characterised by mechanical features only G05G; sensitive
elements, see the appropriate subclass, e.g. G12B, subclass of G01, H01; correcting units, see the
appropriate subclass, e.g. H02K)
1. This subclass covers features of control systems or elements for regulating specific variables, which are clearly more
2. This subclass does not cover:
a. systems for controlling or regulating non-electric variables in general, which are covered by subclass G05D;
b. systems for regulating electric or magnetic variables in general, which are covered by subclass G05F;
c. systems specially adapted for the control of particular machines or apparatus provided for in a single other subclass, which
are classified in the relevant subclass for such machines or apparatus, provided that there is specific provision for control
or regulation relevant to the special adaptation. Otherwise, classification is made in the most appropriate place in this
3. IIn this subclass, the following terms or expressions are used with the meanings indicated:
• "automatic controller" means a system, circuit, or device in which a signal from the detecting element is compared
with a signal representing the desired value and which operates in such a way as to reduce the deviation. The automatic
controller generally does not include the sensitive element, i.e. that element which measures the value of the condition to
be corrected, or the correcting element, i.e. that element which adjusts the condition to be corrected;
• "electric" includes "electromechanical", "electrohydraulic" or "electropneumatic".
4. In this subclass, details or specific control systems are classified in the group relevant to that system, if not otherwise provided
In this subclass non-limiting references (in the sense of paragraph 39 of the Guide to the IPC) may still be displayed in the
