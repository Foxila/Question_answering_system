2. In this subclass, the following term is used with the meaning indicated:
• "systems" includes self-contained devices such as speed governors, pressure regulators.
3. Control systems specially adapted for particular apparatus, machines or processes are classified in the subclasses for the
apparatus, machines or processes, provided that there is specific provision for control or regulation relevant to the special
adaptation, either at a detailed level, e.g. A21B 1/40: "for regulating temperature in bakers' ovens", or at a general level, e.g.
B23K 9/095: "for automatic control of welding parameters in arc welding". Otherwise, classification is made in the most
appropriate place in this subclass.
