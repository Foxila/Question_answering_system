COOPERATIVE PATENT CLASSIFICATION
SIGNALLING OR CALLING SYSTEMS; ORDER TELEGRAPHS; ALARM SYSTEMS
1. This subclass covers also means for identifying or incapacitating burglars or the like.
2. This subclass does not cover:
• the mere provision of an audible or visible signalling device on measuring or switching apparatus;
• alarm systems for indicating that a specific variable has exceeded, or fallen below, a predetermined value, which are
covered by the relevant subclasses of class G01 for the measurement of that variable.
• alarms for specific processes or types of machines or apparatus, which are covered by the relevant subclasses for the
processes, machines, or apparatus.
3. In this subclass, the following term is used with the meaning indicated:
• "systems" may cover also devices peculiar thereto.
In this subclass non-limiting references (in the sense of paragraph 39 of the Guide to the IPC) may still be displayed in the
