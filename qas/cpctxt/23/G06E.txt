COOPERATIVE PATENT CLASSIFICATION
COMPUTING; CALCULATING OR COUNTING
OPTICAL COMPUTING DEVICES; {COMPUTING DEVICES USING OTHER
RADIATIONS WITH SIMILAR PROPERTIES}(optical logic elements per se G02F 3/00;
digital storage using optical elements G11C 13/04)
1. This subclass covers all devices in which at least one computing function is performed by optical means.
2. If other aspects, for example mechanical, fluid pressure or electrical computing, are of interest, classification is also made in
the relevant subclass for such aspects.
    1/00    Devices for processing exclusively digital data
    1/02    . operating upon the order or content of the data
    1/04    . . for performing computations using exclusively
denominational number representation, e.g. using
binary, ternary, decimal representation
    1/045   . . . {Matrix or vector computation}
    1/06    . . for performing computations using a digital
