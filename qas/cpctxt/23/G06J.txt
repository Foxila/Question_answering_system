HYBRID COMPUTING ARRANGEMENTS (optical hybrid computing devices G06E 3/00;
{fuzzy computing G06N 7/02}; neural networks for image data processing G06T; analog/digital
conversion, in general H03M 1/00)
In this subclass, the following expression is used with the meaning indicated:
â€¢ "hybrid computing arrangement" is an arrangement in which part of the computation is digital and part is analogue.
In this subclass non-limiting references (in the sense of paragraph 39 of the Guide to the IPC) may still be displayed in the
