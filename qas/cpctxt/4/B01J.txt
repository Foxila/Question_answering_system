1. In this subclass, the following terms or expressions are used with the meanings indicated :
• "solid particles" includes such particles whether catalysts, reactants or inert in solid,semi-solid or pasty state;
• "fluidised particles" means finely divided solid particles lifted and agitated by a stream of fluid;
• "fluidised bed-technique" means fluid-solid contacting technique in which finely divided particles are lifted and agitated
by a rising stream of fluid, said stream having such a speed as to form a lower dense phase (the "bed") and an upper dilute
fluidised phase of "fluidised particles";
• "processes conducted in the presence of solid particles" does not include processes wherein the only solid particles present
are formed during the reaction.
2. In this subclass, tradenames that are often found in scientific and patent literature have been used in order to define precisely

1. Group B01J 31/003 takes precedence over groups
B01J 31/02 - B01J 31/24 (catalytic antibodies
2. In this group, the following terms or expressions
are used with the meanings indicated:
• "Organic compound" a compound in which
(2)at least one atom of hydrogen or halogen;
(3)nitrogen by a single or double
bond; except cyanic acid (HOCN),
cyanogen (NCCN), cyanamide (H2NCN),
cyanogen halide (HalCN), hydrocyanic
acid (HCN) isocyanic acid (HNCO)
carbides (MCCM) (catalysts comprising
any of these exceptions or their salts
• "Organometallic compounds" includes all
organic compounds wherein a metal or
metalloid atom is bonded directly to a carbon
fragment, the latter being formally anionic,
no further neutral ligands being coordinated
to the metal and the compound requiring no
further cations for charge balance; e.g. M(1-
CR3)n with M= main group metal, n= valency
of metal and R= H or hydrocarbyl. (Compounds
comprising anionic organonitrogen,
organooxygen and organosulfur fragments,
excluding carboxylates, with a metal bonded to
these heteroatoms B01J 31/02 - B01J 31/0254;
unsaturated carbon fragments in combination
with transition metals B01J 31/2282.
• "Coordination complexes" includes any
donor-acceptor compounds or complex ions
comprising organic or inorganic, anionic or
neutral Lewis basic ligands, attached to a
Lewis acid central metal or metal ion through
one or several complexing donor atoms with
at least one lone-pair of electrons, e.g. N,
O, S, P, to provide at least a Sigma-bond.
Typically the maximum number of same or
different ligands according to the coordination
number, spatial requirements of the ligand and
electronic configuration of the metal is bound in
a predictable geometry. Complexes of neutral,
cationic or anionic hydrocarbon ligands with
delocalised charge and/or bonding site, e.g.
Pd-olefin complexes or metallocenes, are also
included (the following groups take precedence:
simple hydrocarbyl metal compounds, e.g.
of main group metal(loids) B01J 31/12;
oxoacid salts B01J 31/04 - B01J 31/10; other
compounds comprising anionic organonitrogen,
organooxygen and organosulfur fragments
with a metal bonded to these heteroatoms
• "Organometallic complexes" includes all
coordination complexes comprising a M-C
bond, e.g. metal carbonyls (complex cyanides
such as M4[Fe(CN)6] B01J 27/26 ).Included
are furthermore complexes which are not
strictly organometallic per se, e.g. comprising
only N, O, S and/or P coordinated ligands, but
are described as involving, or known to involve,
organometallic intermediates and/or transition
states during use, e.g. Group 8-10 metal
complexes for a variety of catalytic reactions
or steps thereof, such as oxidative addition,
e.g. of ArX, hydrogenation, carbonylation,
• "Organic complexes" includes all coordination
complexes comprising organic ligands (groups
B01J 31/1608 - B01J 31/1895 take precedence).
• "Polymer" includes any macromolecular
substance (typically M>10000 g/mol), which
comprises repeating units made up of one or
several kinds of atoms or groups of atoms,
which are identically connected to one another.
Oligomers, i.e. more than two identical
repeating units connected to one another and
typically 500<M<10000 g/mol, are grouped
with the respective polymers (polymers per se
3. In this group, if two or more aspects are of equal
importance, these are each classified, e.g. two
components in a catalyst system such as:
• support and pendant or otherwise immobilised
• coordination complex and essential additive.
14Solid sorbent compositions or filter aid compositions; Sorbents for chromatography; Catalysts
However, if two components, even if separately
added, are described as forming, or known
to form, a coordination complex, only the
latter is classified, e.g. phosphine and Group
8-10 metal such as rhodium. The groups
B01J 31/26 - B01J 31/38 are not to be used for the
central metals in coordination complexes but rather
for separately added further inorganic ingredients.
Each specifically disclosed alternative is separately
classified, i.e. specifically disclosed by ways of
worked examples, specific claims and/or explicit

disclosed central metal(s) therein, as well as

 2531/00    Additional information regarding catalytic systems
In this group the term "Metals" refers to the
central metal in the coordination complexes
( B01J 31/16 - B01J 31/24), as used for
the respective catalytic reaction, excluding
carboxylates (see B01J 31/04 ) and other
simple salts or organometallic compounds
(see B01J 31/12 ). As to components, only
those metals or solvents are indexed which
are explicitly mentioned in the claims or the
worked examples. As to compositional aspects,
only those are provided for in the scheme
below and are intended to be indexed, which
provide additional information regarding
the complexes and/or ligands classified in
B01J 31/16 - B01J 31/24; indexing codes
B01J 2531/0286 - B01J 2531/0297 are only
used if these aspects are described as essential.
Indexing codes B01J 2531/0213 - B01J 2531/0277
characterise the complexes on the basis of
bond-type (linkage-type) thereby specifying
the structural geometry of the complexes, while
classification entries B01J 31/16 - B01J 31/24 are
purely compositional subdivisions. The individual
metals, the compositional aspects of complexes
used and the solvents are indexed for each explicit
alternative, according to the guideline above
 2531/001   . General concepts, e.g. reviews, relating to catalyst
systems and methods of making them, the concept
being defined by a common material or method/

only if groups with closely related members
are concerned, e.g. N-heterocyclic carbenes (
B01J 2531/004 ), Pd-complexes ( B01J 2531/005
