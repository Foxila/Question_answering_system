COOPERATIVE PATENT CLASSIFICATION
PERFORMING OPERATIONS; TRANSPORTING
CENTRIFUGAL APPARATUS OR MACHINES FOR CARRYING-OUT PHYSICAL OR
CENTRIFUGES (high-speed drum mills B02C 19/11; domestic spin driers D06F; analysing,
measuring or monitoring physical or chemical properties of samples during centrifuging, see the
relevant subclasses for these procedures, e.g. G01N)
This subclass covers machines or apparatus for separating, mixing, drying, extracting, purifying, or like treating in which
centrifugal effects are generated by rotary bowls or other rotors. Where such machines or apparatus involve pumping effects,
such effects must be incidental or subsidiary to the treating.
In this subclass non-limiting references (in the sense of paragraph 39 of the Guide to the IPC) may still be displayed in the
