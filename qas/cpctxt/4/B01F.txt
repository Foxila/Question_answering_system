MIXING, e.g. DISSOLVING, EMULSIFYING OR DISPERSING (mixing paints
• agitation or homogenisation of products formed by a combination of two or more components with the purpose of
obtaining a homogeneous composition or homogeneous conditions in the mass of material;
• stirring of a single material with the purpose of obtaining homogeneous conditions in the mass of material;
• mixing, agitation and homogenisation of materials, irrespective of the application in which it is produced, whenever the
device or the method are directed to achieve the desired effect.
