harmless or less harmful, by effecting a chemical
change in the substances (consuming noxious gases
â€¢ chemical or physico-chemical type processes
where eradicating or diminishing the
dangerousness of harmful chemical substances
produces useful products, e.g. cement.
These types of processes are covered by
the appropriate subclass for making the
specific product. However, in situations where
processes for making products include a subset
of process steps with eradicating or diminishing
the dangerousness of a harmful chemical
substance as its fundamental goal, and this
subset is in itself novel and unobvious, this
subset is covered by group A62D 3/00.
2. In this group the following term is used with the
meaning indicated: "harmful chemical substances"
are chemical waste substances which are too
hazardous or toxic to be discarded in an ordinary
3. In this group, the first place priority rule is applied,
i.e. at each hierarchical level, in the absence of an
indication to the contrary, classification is made in
4. In this group, it is desirable to add the indexing
code(s) of group A62D 2101/00 relating to the
nature of the harmful chemical substance.
Processes for combatting harmful chemical
substances or agents or materials containing
harmful chemical agents. These processes
can be chemical or physico-chemical,
e.g. use of special chemical reagents
for chemical fixing, and result in the
decomposition or transformation of
the agents in harmless or less harmful
substances, because of the change in its
chemical constitution. These processes can
comprise the step of dissolving or dispersing
the hazardous substances in water for the
purpose of treating them or the step of
producing a gaseous product from a non-
