COOPERATIVE PATENT CLASSIFICATION
PERFORMING OPERATIONS; TRANSPORTING
CENTRIFUGAL APPARATUS OR MACHINES FOR CARRYING-OUT PHYSICAL OR
APPARATUS USING FREE VORTEX FLOW, e.g. CYCLONES ({centrifugal separation of
water from steam B01D 45/12;} jet mills B02C 19/06; {wind sifters B07B 7/00;} cyclonic type
combustion apparatus F23; {vortex burners for cyclone-type combustion apparatus F23D 1/02;
cyclonic type combustion apparatus for gas turbines F23R 3/00})
This subclass covers apparatus for separating, mixing or like treating in which centrifugal effects are generated by free vortex
flow, otherwise than by rotary bowls, rotors or curved passages.
In this subclass non-limiting references (in the sense of paragraph 39 of the Guide to the IPC) may still be displayed in the
    1/00    Apparatus in which the main direction of flow
follows a flat spiral {; so-called flat cyclones or
    3/00    Apparatus in which the axial direction of the
vortex {(flow following a screw-thread type line)}
remains unchanged {Also devices in which one of
the two discharge ducts returns centrally through
the vortex chamber, a reverse-flow vortex being
prevented by bulkheads in the central discharge
duct (combined with other devices B04C 9/00)}
