COOPERATIVE PATENT CLASSIFICATION
PERFORMING OPERATIONS; TRANSPORTING
PHYSICAL OR CHEMICAL PROCESSES OR APPARATUS IN GENERAL
SEPARATION (separating solids from solids by wet methods B03B, B03D; by pneumatic jigs
or tables B03B; by other dry methods B07; magnetic or electrostatic separation of solid materials
from solid materials or fluids, separation by high-voltage electric fields B03C; centrifuges,
vortex apparatus B04; presses per se for squeezing-out liquid from liquid-containing material
B30B 9/02; treatment of water C02F, e.g. softening by ion-exchange C02F 1/42; {arrangements
of air intake cleaners in gas turbine plants F02C 7/05} ; arrangements or mounting of filters in
air-conditioning, air-humidification or ventilation F24F 13/28)
• evaporation, distillation, crystallisation, filtration, dust precipitation, gas cleaning, absorption, adsorption;
• similar processes which are not concerned with, or limited to, separation, except in the case of absorption or adsorption.
2. In this subclass, the terms or expressions are used with the meaning indicated:
• "filtration" and analogous terms include straining solids from fluids. Filtration is a process that normally uses a filter
• "filter medium" is a porous material or porous arrangement of material used to filter solids from fluids;
• "filtering element" is a section of filter medium in addition to parts to which the medium is demountably or permanently
fixed, including other sections of medium, end caps, peripheral frames or edge strips, but excluding housings;
• "filter housing" is the fluid-constraining impervious vessel, whether open or closed, which contains, or is adapted to
contain, one or more filtering elements or filter media;
• "filter chamber" is the space within a housing, where filtering elements or filter media are located. Partitions may divide a
single housing into a plurality of chambers;
• "filtering apparatus" consists of filtering elements combined with housings, cleaning arrangements, motor or the like parts,
which are characteristic of the particular type of apparatus. Ancillary devices such as pumps or valves are considered part
of a filtering apparatus when inside the apparatus. Ancillary devices performing similar or different unit operation such as
comminutors, mixers or non-filtering separators, whether or not inside the apparatus, are not considered part of a filtering
apparatus. The term does not extend to apparatus, e.g. washing machines, of which the filter forms only a part.
3. For apparatus used in drying or evaporation, class F26 takes precedence over this subclass.
4. Group B01D 59/00 takes precedence over the other groups of this subclass and over other subclasses in class B01.
5. {In this subclass, combination sets [C-Sets] are used. The detailed information about the C-Sets construction and the
associated syntax rules are found in the definitions of B01D.}

specific compound as the main substance
are only classified in the, for this specific
compound, corresponding B01D 19/0404
subgroup (e.g. polysiloxanes receive the
classification B01D 19/0409 ); when
the specific compound(s) is (are) not
the main substance, then the attributed
classification for this compound(s) is
a combination of B01D 19/0404 + the
corresponding B01D 19/0404 subgroup(s),
(e.g. hydrocarbons containing silica are
classified in B01D 19/0404 + B01D 19/0409 ).
If the main substance is a mixture containing
more than one specific compound, then the
attributed classification is a combination of the
