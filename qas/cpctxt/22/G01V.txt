1. This subclass covers radar, sonar, lidar or analogous systems specifically designed for geophysical use. Radar, sonar, lidar or
analogous systems, or details of such systems, if of a general interest, are also classified in subclass G01S.
2. In this subclass, the following term is used with the meaning indicated:
• "tags" means arrangements cooperating with a detecting field, e.g. near field, and designed to produce a specific detectable
effect; "tags" also means active markers capable of generating a detectable field.
3. In this subclass, the geophysical methods apply both to the earth and to other celestial objects, e.g. planets.
4. Attention is drawn to the Notes following the title of class G01.
