• the production of permanent directly-visible pictures in  conformity with an original picture or document, using an
intermediate imagewise distribution of an electric or  magnetic quantity, such as a charge pattern, an electric  conductivity
pattern, or a magnetic pattern;
• the production of permanent directly-visible pictures  using an intermediate imagewise distribution of an  electric or
magnetic quantity, when the origin and the  way of generating said intermediate distribution are not  relevant.
2. This subclass does not cover:
• use of electric signals for the transmission of the  picture information from the original to the reproduction,  i.e. pictorial
communication, which is covered by subclass H04N;
• production of pictures by heat patterns exclusively, not  using an electrostatic or magnetic pattern, which is  covered by
• production of prints by transferring ink from a printing  form to a printing surface, without physical contact and  using the
force of an electrostatic field, which is  covered by subclass B41M;
• selective printing mechanisms characterised by the  selective supply of electric current, or the selective  application of
magnetism or radiation, to a printing  material or impression-transfer material, which are  covered by groups B41J 2/385,
