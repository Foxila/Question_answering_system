1. This subclass covers methods or arrangements for preventing the formation of electrostatic charges on bodies or for carrying-
off these charges after their formation.
2. This subclass does not cover specific applications of the above-mentioned methods or arrangements, e.g. during the
manufacture of artificial fibres or films, which are covered by the relevant subclasses.
In this subclass non-limiting references (in the sense of paragraph 39 of the Guide to the IPC) may still be displayed in the
