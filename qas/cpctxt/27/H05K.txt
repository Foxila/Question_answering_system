• combinations of a radio or television receiver with apparatus having a different main function;
• printed circuits structurally associated with non-printed electric components.
2. In this subclass, the following expression is used with the meaning indicated:
• "printed circuits" covers all kinds of mechanical constructions of circuits that consist of an insulating base or support
carrying the conductor and are combined structurally with the conductor throughout their length, especially in a two-
dimensional plane, the conductors of which are secured to the base in a non-dismountable manner, and also covers the
processes or apparatus for manufacturing such constructions, e.g. forming the circuit by mechanical or chemical treatment
of a conductive foil, paste, or film on an insulating support.
