ARRANGEMENT OF SIGNALLING OR LIGHTING DEVICES, THE MOUNTING
OR SUPPORTING THEREOF OR CIRCUITS THEREFOR, FOR VEHICLES IN
1. This subclass also covers the operation and control of lighting devices, for example:
• arrangement or adaptation of lighting switches or signal-initiating means for vehicles;
• control of lighting devices in relation to the vehicle as a whole, e.g. for levelling, swivelling or aiming.
2. This subclass does not cover optical, mechanical, thermal or electrical arrangement of elements within lighting devices, which
are covered by groups F21S 41/00 – F21S 45/00.
