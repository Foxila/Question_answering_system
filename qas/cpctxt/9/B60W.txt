COOPERATIVE PATENT CLASSIFICATION
PERFORMING OPERATIONS; TRANSPORTING
CONJOINT CONTROL OF VEHICLE SUB-UNITS OF DIFFERENT TYPE OR
DIFFERENT FUNCTION; CONTROL SYSTEMS SPECIALLY ADAPTED FOR
HYBRID VEHICLES; ROAD VEHICLE DRIVE CONTROL SYSTEMS FOR
PURPOSES NOT RELATED TO THE CONTROL OF A PARTICULAR SUB-UNIT
1. This subclass does not cover the control of a single sub-unit; such control is classified in the relevant place for the sub-unit,
e.g. F02D, F16H. Where a single sub-unit is controlled by means of signals or commands from other sub-units, the control of
this single sub-unit is classified in the relevant place for this sub-unit. For example, the control of variable-ratio gearing by
means of signals from the engine or the accelerator is classified in the subclass for gearing, F16H.
2. Conjoint control of driveline units, e.g. engines, and variable-ratio gearing occurring only transiently during ratio shift and
being also characterised by the control of the gearing is also classified in the subclass for gearing, F16H.
3. When classifying in group B60W 10/00, classification must also be made in groups B60W 20/00 - B60W 60/00 in order to
identify the purpose or use of the control.
4. In this subclass, the following terms are used with the meanings indicated:
• "conjoint control" means that a programmed or condition-responsive {main} automatic controller on board the vehicle,
embodying control logic for vehicle sub-units of different type or different function, sends control signals to actuators of
two or more vehicle sub-units, so that the sub-units act together to solve a particular problem or in response to a particular
driving condition {in order to improve stability, comfort or safety by managing the global dynamics of the vehicle};
• "drive control system" means an electronic system on board a road vehicle for automatically controlling the movement {by
managing the global dynamics} of that vehicle in order to take certain actions{in order to improve stability, comfort or
• "road vehicle" means a motorised vehicle for transportation on roads, e.g. an automobile, truck or bus;
• "autonomous road vehicle" means a road vehicle capable of controlling all dynamic driving tasks without human
intervention during {a plurality of} driving scenarios by using on-board computer hardware and software to execute
decision making processes in real-time.
• "sub-unit" means one of the following vehicle systems: {driveline systems, e.g.} propulsion system, clutch system, change-
speed gearing system, system for distributing drive torque between front and rear axles, axle differential system, brake
system, steering system, suspension system, {and, particularly for hybrid vehicles,} energy storage means, fuel cells, or
In this subclass non-limiting references (in the sense of paragraph 39 of the Guide to the IPC) may still be displayed in the
   10/00    Conjoint control of vehicle sub-units of different
type or different function (for propulsion of purely
electrically-propelled vehicles with power supplied
within the vehicle B60L 50/00 - B60L 58/00)
When classifying in this group, each controlled
sub-unit must be separately identified by a
classification in a relevant place in this group.
