COOPERATIVE PATENT CLASSIFICATION
PERFORMING OPERATIONS; TRANSPORTING
LAND VEHICLES FOR TRAVELLING OTHERWISE THAN ON RAILS
BRAKES SPECIALLY ADAPTED FOR CYCLES {(arrangements in cycles for adjusting
wheel-braking force to meet varying vehicular or ground-surface conditions B60T 8/00)}
1. This subclass covers only adaptations of brakes and their actuating mechanisms peculiar to their use on cycles.
2. This subclass does not cover brakes or actuating mechanisms of wider applicability, which are regarded as of general type,
irrespective of whether described or claimed only for cycles, which are covered by subclass  B60T or the relevant subclass of
In this subclass non-limiting references (in the sense of paragraph 39 of the Guide to the IPC) may still be displayed in the
