1. In this subclass, the following terms or expressions are used with the meanings indicated:
• "air" also includes other gaseous cooling fluids;
• "liquid cooling" also includes cooling where liquid is used as the heat transferring fluid between parts to be cooled and the
• "air cooling" means direct air cooling and thus excludes indirect air cooling occurring in liquid cooling systems as
• "cooling-air" includes directly or indirectly acting cooling-air.
2. Attention is drawn to the notes preceding class F01, especially as regards Note (3).
3. Cooling by lubricant is classified in subclass F01M when the lubrication aspect predominates and in subclass F01P when the
