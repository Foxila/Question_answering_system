COOPERATIVE PATENT CLASSIFICATION
BUILDINGS OR LIKE STRUCTURES FOR PARTICULAR PURPOSES; SWIMMING
OR SPLASH BATHS OR POOLS; MASTS; FENCING; TENTS OR CANOPIES, IN
1. This subclass deals primarily with the layout of buildings as a whole, but includes details which are peculiar to types of
buildings or buildings for special purposes, specified in the groups. The word "buildings" does not exclude engineering
structures and other constructions
2. This subclass provides for canopies in general and for canopies similar in construction to tents. For canopies having special
application, see the relevant class, e.g. bed canopies A47C 29/00; protecting chairs against the weather A47C 7/66; sunshades
or awnings for buildings E04F 10/00
3. In this subclass, the term "tent" means a tent or canopy having a supporting means, e.g. frame and a flexible cover
