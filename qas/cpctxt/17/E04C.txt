1. In this group, the following terms or expressions
are used with the meanings indicated:
• "reinforcing" means increasing any physical
strength  characteristic of the end product, e.g.
compressive or flexural strength;
• "elements" includes relatively large bodies, e.g.
steel bars, as well as relatively small discrete
bodies of any form, e.g. glass fibres.

compared with the reinforced building element,
