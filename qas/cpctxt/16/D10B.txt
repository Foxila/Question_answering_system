INDEXING SCHEME ASSOCIATED WITH SUBLASSES OF SECTION D, RELATING
INDEXING SCHEME ASSOCIATED WITH SUBLASSES OF SECTION D, RELATING
1. This subclass constitutes a scheme for indexing only.
2. The indexing codes of this subclass, relating to the chemical constitution of the fibrous materials, are to be associated with
groups of section D, with the exception of those of subclass D06M, as far as these groups themselves do not give information
about the chemical nature of the fibres.
3. In a number of fields, the indexing codes relating to the chemical constitution of the fibrous materials are not allotted to
documents having an abstract in which the chemical constitution is clearly stated, e.g. if the abstract mentions "polyamide",
code D10B 2331/021 is not allotted.
4. Blends of fibres are indexed according to each constituent fibre.
