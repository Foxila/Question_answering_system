1. This subclass covers also pulp compositions for the preparation of fibreboard or other fibrous articles by wet processes.
2. In this subclass, the following terms are used with the meaning indicated:
• "pulp" means a dispersion, { e.g. an aqueous suspension,} comprising paper-making fibres and optional additives, which
is to be processed, and covers the term "stock"; it also means dry paper-making fibres which are to be made into paper by
• "paper" means paper, cardboard or wet-laid non-woven fabrics.
