The term "packaging" should be understood as including mainly the  following operations:
filling portable containers or receptacles with materials or small  articles to form packages
inserting articles, or groups of articles, into containers or  receptacles
closing filled containers or receptacles otherwise than by metal-,  glass-, or wood-working operations
enclosing, or partially enclosing, articles or quantities of  material, in sheets, strips, blanks, webs, or tubes of thin flexible
bundling articles, e.g. holding articles together in groups by  applying string or wire
attaching articles to cards, sheets, or webs
Operations of these types employed in the manufacture of articles  other than packages are classified in other appropriate
subclasses, e.g.  making confectionery products by casting in moulds formed by wrappers  A23G, filling ammunition
cartridges F42B      Methods of packaging which are wholly characterised by the form of  the package produced, or the form
of the container or packaging-element  utilised, are to be classified in B65D rather than in this subclass      In the following
elaborations, the term "package" is used to mean  the end product of a packaging operation, e.g. a filled and closed  container,
an article enclosed in a wrapper, a group of articles held  together by string or wire, a crate of bottles      In the following
elaborations, the term "materials" is to be  understood as embracing matter, or masses of articles, which are to be  packaged,
as distinct from separate or individual articles     Machines, apparatus or methods of general application for packaging  articles
