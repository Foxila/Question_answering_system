SPECIALLY ADAPTED FOR SUCH VEHICLES (arrangements or mounting of
transmissions in vehicles in general B60K; transmission elements per se F16)
In this subclass, the term "transmission" means all parts between the prime mover or the part to which a rider immediately
applies propulsive effort, e.g. pedal cranks, and a driven ground wheel.
In this subclass non-limiting references (in the sense of paragraph 39 of the Guide to the IPC) may still be displayed in the
