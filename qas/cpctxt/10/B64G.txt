COOPERATIVE PATENT CLASSIFICATION
PERFORMING OPERATIONS; TRANSPORTING
AIRCRAFT; AVIATION; COSMONAUTICS
COSMONAUTICS; VEHICLES OR EQUIPMENT THEREFOR (apparatus for, or methods
of, winning materials from extraterrestrial sources E21C 51/00)
1. This subclass  covers only vehicles, equipment or the like, which are specially adapted for cosmonautics.
2. This subclass  does not cover vehicles and equipment applicable to both cosmonautics and aeronautics, which are covered by
the appropriate aeronautical subclasses of class  B64.
3. In this subclass, the following term is used with the meaning indicated:
â€¢ "cosmonautics" includes all transport outside the earth's atmosphere, and thus includes artificial earth satellites, and
interplanetary and interstellar travel.
In this subclass non-limiting references (in the sense of paragraph 39 of the Guide to the IPC) may still be displayed in the
