3. This subclass, which is intended to be as comprehensive as possible, only excludes containers or packages of a nature clearly
confined to a single other subclass, which are classified in that subclass
4. In this subclass, groups B65D 5/00, B65D 27/00, B65D 29/00, B65D 31/00 or B65D 65/00 include constructional features
of foldable or erectable container or wrapper blanks as well as the containers or wrappers formed by folding or erecting such

constructional or functional features, if such features are of interest
6. In this subclass, the following terms or expressions are used with the meanings indicated:

a. containers not deformed by, or not taking-up the shape of, their contents;
b. containers adapted to be temporarily deformed to expel their contents;
• "flexible containers" includes:
a. containers deformed by, or taking-up the shape of, their contents:
b. containers adapted to be permanently deformed to expel their contents;

• "large containers", in groups B65D 88/00 or B65D 90/00, means containers having about the size of containers used in
container traffic, sometimes referred to as freight, forwarding or "ISO" (International Standardization) containers, or larger
