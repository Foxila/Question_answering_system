COOPERATIVE PATENT CLASSIFICATION
NUCLEAR PHYSICS; NUCLEAR ENGINEERING
CONVERSION OF CHEMICAL ELEMENTS; RADIOACTIVE SOURCES (applications
of radiation in general G21H 5/00; handling particles, e.g. neutrons, or electromagnetic radiation
not otherwise provided for G21K)
In this subclass non-limiting references (in the sense of paragraph 39 of the Guide to the IPC) may still be displayed in the
    1/00    Arrangements for converting chemical elements
by electromagnetic radiation, corpuscular
radiation or particle bombardment, e.g. producing
radioactive isotopes (separation of different isotopes
of the same element B01D 59/00)

    1/02    . in nuclear reactors (by thermonuclear reactions
G21B; conversion of nuclear fuel G21C)
    1/04    . outside nuclear reactors or particle accelerators
    1/06    . . by neutron irradiation
    1/08    . . . accompanied by nuclear fission
    1/10    . . by bombardment with electrically charged
particles (irradiation devices G21K 5/00)
    1/12    . . by electromagnetic irradiation, e.g. with gamma
