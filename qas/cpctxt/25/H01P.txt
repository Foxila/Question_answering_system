COOPERATIVE PATENT CLASSIFICATION
WAVEGUIDES; RESONATORS, LINES, OR OTHER DEVICES OF THE
WAVEGUIDE TYPE (operating at optical frequencies G02B)
In this subclass, the following expression is used with the meaning indicated :
• "waveguide type" as applied to transmission lines includes  only high-frequency coaxial cables or Lecher lines, and as
applied to resonators, delay lines, or other devices includes  all devices having distributed inductance and capacitance.
In this subclass non-limiting references (in the sense of paragraph 39 of the Guide to the IPC) may still be displayed in the
