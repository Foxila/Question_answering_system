COOPERATIVE PATENT CLASSIFICATION
WAVEGUIDES; RESONATORS, LINES, OR OTHER DEVICES OF THE
WAVEGUIDE TYPE (operating at optical frequencies G02B)
In this subclass, the following expression is used with the meaning indicated :
â€¢ "waveguide type" as applied to transmission lines includes  only high-frequency coaxial cables or Lecher lines, and as
applied to resonators, delay lines, or other devices includes  all devices having distributed inductance and capacitance.
