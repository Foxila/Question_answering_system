COOPERATIVE PATENT CLASSIFICATION
ELECTRICALLY-CONDUCTIVE CONNECTIONS; STRUCTURAL ASSOCIATIONS
OF A PLURALITY OF MUTUALLY-INSULATED ELECTRICAL CONNECTING
ELEMENTS; COUPLING DEVICES; CURRENT COLLECTORS
• all kinds of contact-making disconnectable and non-disconnectable electric line connecting devices, coupling devices,
lamp or similar holders or current collectors for all kinds of electric lines, cables or apparatus;
• non-printed means for electric connections to or between printed circuits.
2. This subclass does not cover mounting of connections in or on specified apparatus. Such mounting is covered by the relevant
subclass for such apparatus, e.g. mounting in junction or distribution boxes is covered by subclass H02B or H02G, high-
temperature connections for heating elements is covered by group H05B 3/08. Structural association of one part of a coupling
device with specific electric apparatus is classified with the apparatus, e.g. association of cap with incandescent lamp is
3. In this subclass, the following expressions are used with the meaning indicated:
• "pin" is a rigid or flexible conductor for engagement with an appropriately shaped socket to establish contact therewith;
• "socket" is a rigid or flexible conductor for receiving an appropriate pin to establish electrical contact therewith;
• "coupling devices" are devices having two or more parts specially adapted so as to be capable of ready and repeated
physical engagement or disengagement, without the use of a tool, for the purpose of establishing or breaking an electrical
path. Examples of such devices having more than two parts:
a. adapters for linking two coupling parts;
b. rails or bus-bars provided with a plurality of discrete connecting locations for counterparts.
