1. This subclass covers (in groups H01H 69/00 - H01H 87/00) devices for the protection of electric lines or electric machines or
apparatus in the event of undesired change from normal electric working conditions, the electrical condition serving directly

3. In this subclass, the following terms or expressions are used with the meanings indicated :
• "relay" means a switching device having contacts which are  operated from electric inputs which supply, directly or
indirectly, all the mechanical energy necessary to cause  both the closure and the opening of the contacts;
• "driving mechanism" refers to the means by which an operating  force applied to the switch is transmitted to the moving
• "operating" is used in a broader sense than "actuating"  which is reserved for those parts not touched by hand  to effect
• "acting" or "action" means a self-induced movement of parts  at one stage of the switching.
These connotations apply to all parts of the verbs "to operate", "to actuate" and "to act" and to words derived therefrom, e.g. to
4. In this subclass, details are classified as follows :
• details of an unspecified type of switching device, or  disclosed as applicable to two or more kinds of switching  devices
designated by the terms or expressions "switches",  "relays", "selector switches", and "emergency protective  devices", are
classified in groups H01H 1/00 - H01H 9/00;
• details of an unspecified type of switch, or disclosed as  applicable to two or more types of switches as defined by  groups
H01H 13/00 - H01H 43/00 and sub-groups H01H 35/02, H01H 35/06, H01H 35/14, H01H 35/18, H01H 35/24 and

H01H 73/00 - H01H 83/00, hereinafter called basic  types, are classified in H01H 71/00.
• However, details only described with reference to, or clearly only applicable to, switching devices of a single basic type,
are classified in the group appropriate to switching devices of that basic type, e.g. H01H 19/02, H01H 75/04;
• mechanical structural details of control members of switches  or of keyboards such as keys, push-buttons, levers or other
mechanisms for transferring the force to the activated  elements are classified in this subclass, even when they are  used for
controlling electronic switches.
