COOPERATIVE PATENT CLASSIFICATION
PROCESSES OR MEANS, e.g. BATTERIES, FOR THE DIRECT CONVERSION OF
CHEMICAL ENERGY INTO ELECTRICAL ENERGY
This subclass covers galvanic primary or secondary cells or batteries, fuel cells or stacks.
In this subclass non-limiting references (in the sense of paragraph 39 of the Guide to the IPC) may still be displayed in the
In classifying electrodes of hybrid cells, the
individual half-cells of the hybrid cell are
considered separately, e.g. an electrode in the
primary half of a primary/fuel type hybrid cell is
considered to be a primary-cell electrode covered
