COOPERATIVE PATENT CLASSIFICATION
ELECTRIC DISCHARGE TUBES OR DISCHARGE LAMPS (spark-gaps H01T; arc lamps
with consumable electrodes H05B; particle accelerators H05H)
1. This subclass covers only devices for producing, influencing, or using a flow of electrons or ions, e.g. for controlling,
indicating, or switching of electric current, counting electric pulses, producing light or other electromagnetic oscillations, such
as X-rays, or for separating or analysing radiation or particles, and having a closed or substantially closed casing containing
a chosen gas, vapour, or vacuum, upon the pressure and nature of which the characteristics of the device depend. Light
sources using a combination (other than covered by group H01J 61/96 of this subclass) of discharge and other kinds of light
generation are dealt with in H05B 35/00.
2. In this subclass, groups H01J 1/00 - H01J 7/00  relate only to:
i. details of an unspecified kind of discharge tube or lamp, or
ii. details mentioned in a specification as applicable to two or more kinds of tubes or lamps as defined by groups H01J 11/00,
H01J 13/00, H01J 15/00, H01J 17/00, H01J 21/00, H01J 25/00, H01J 27/00, H01J 31/00, H01J 33/00, H01J 35/00,
H01J 37/00, H01J 40/00, H01J 41/00, H01J 47/00, H01J 49/00, H01J 61/00, H01J 63/00 or H01J 65/00, hereinafter called
basic kinds. A detail only described with reference to, or clearly only applicable to, tubes or lamps of a single basic kind is
classified in the detail group appropriate to tubes or lamps of that basic kind, e.g. H01J 17/04.
3. In this subclass, the following term is used with the meaning indicated:
• "lamp" includes tubes emitting ultra-violet or infra-red  light.
4. Attention is drawn to the definition of the expression "spark gaps" given in the Note following the title of subclass H01T.
