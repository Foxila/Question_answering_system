COOPERATIVE PATENT CLASSIFICATION
PERFORMING OPERATIONS; TRANSPORTING
MICROSTRUCTURAL TECHNOLOGY; NANOTECHNOLOGY
NANOSTRUCTURES FORMED BY MANIPULATION OF INDIVIDUAL ATOMS,
MOLECULES, OR LIMITED COLLECTIONS OF ATOMS OR MOLECULES AS
DISCRETE UNITS; MANUFACTURE OR TREATMENT THEREOF
1. This subclass does not cover chemical or biological nanostructures per se, provided for elsewhere, e.g. in classes C08 or C12.
2. Attention is drawn to the Note following the title of class B82, which defines the meaning of the terms "nanosize",
"nanoscale" and "nanostructure" in this subclass.
3. Subject matter classified in this subclass is further classified in subclass B82Y, in order to enable a comprehensive search of
nanostructure technology using classification symbols of B82Y in combination with classification symbols of B82B.
4. Nanostructures having specialised features or functions are further classified in appropriate places in other subclasses that
provide for those features or functions, e.g. in G01Q, G02F 1/017, H01L 29/775.
