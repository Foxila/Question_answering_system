1. In this subclass, the following terms or expressions are used with the meanings indicated:
• "fillers" includes pigments, aggregates and fibrous reinforcing materials;
• "active ingredients" includes processing aids or property improvers, e.g. grinding aids  used after the burning process or
used in the absence of a burning process;
• "mortars", "concrete" and "artificial stone" are to be considered as a single group of  materials, and therefore, in the
absence of an indication to the contrary, they include  mortar, concrete and other cementitious compositions.
2. In groups C04B 7/00 - C04B 32/00, in the absence of an indication to the contrary, classification is made in the last
3. A composition classified in groups C04B 26/00 or C04B 28/00 is also classified in groups C04B 14/00 - C04B 24/00 if a filler
or active ingredient is of interest.
4. In groups C04B 2/00 - C04B 32/00 and C04B 38/00 - C04B 41/00 it is desirable to classify the individual constituents of the
mixtures, or other aspects relating to the mixtures or constituents, using Combination Sets with symbols chosen from groups
5. In groups C04B 2/00 - C04B 32/00 and C04B 38/00 - C04B 41/00 it is desirable to classify the function of the individual
constituents of the mixtures, or other aspects relating to the properties or uses of the mixtures or products obtained, using
Combination Sets with symbols chosen from groups C04B 2103/00 - C04B 2111/00.

carbonate and zirconia are used.

if the "invention information" symbol given
indicates that a zirconia-alumina composite
is prepared it is common practice that
zirconia and alumina constituents have
been used and thus no codes for zirconia or

a smaller surface of the other substrate, e.g. butt
 2237/82    . . Two substrates not completely covering each
other, e.g. two plates in a staggered position
 2237/84    . . Joining of a first substrate with a second substrate
at least partially inside the first substrate, where
the bonding area is at the inside of the first
substrate, e.g. one tube inside another tube
 2237/86    . . Joining of two substrates at their largest surfaces,
one surface being complete joined and covered,
the other surface not, e.g. a small plate joined at
it's largest surface on top of a larger plate
 2237/88    . . Joining of two substrates, where a substantial part
of the joining material is present outside of the
joint, leading to an outside joining of the joint
