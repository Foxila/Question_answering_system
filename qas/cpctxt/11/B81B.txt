MICROSTRUCTURAL DEVICES OR SYSTEMS, e.g. MICROMECHANICAL
DEVICES (piezo-electric, electrostrictive or magnetostrictive elements per se H10N 30/00)
1. This subclass does not cover:
• purely electrical or electronic devices per se which are covered by section H, e.g. subclass H01L or class H10;
• purely optical devices per se which are covered by subclasses G02B or G02F;
• essentially two-dimensional structures, e.g. layered products which are covered by subclass B32B;
• chemical or biological structures per se which are covered by section C;
• structures in atomic scale produced by manipulation of single atoms or molecules, which are covered by group B82B 1/00.
2. Devices or systems classified in this subclass are also classified in appropriate subclasses providing for their structural or
functional features, if such features are of interest.
3. Attention is drawn to the following places:
Microcapsules for medicinal preparations
Micromanupulators combined with microscopes
4. In this subclass, local "residual" subgroups, e.g. B81B 7/0077, are used with the following purpose:
When classifying a document which does not fit in any of a set of subgroups with the same dot-level, the document should
be classified in the residual group, if present, and not in the group at the hierarchical level one dot above.
In the example, the document shall be classified in B81B 7/0077 and not in B81B 7/0032 as B81B 7/0077 is "residual" to
In this subclass non-limiting references (in the sense of paragraph 39 of the Guide to the IPC) may still be displayed in the
