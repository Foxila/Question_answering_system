COOPERATIVE PATENT CLASSIFICATION
FERTILISERS; MANUFACTURE THEREOF
MIXTURES OF FERTILISERS COVERED INDIVIDUALLY BY DIFFERENT
SUBCLASSES OF CLASS C05; MIXTURES OF ONE OR MORE FERTILISERS
WITH MATERIALS NOT HAVING A SPECIFIC FERTILISING ACTIVITY, e.g.
PESTICIDES, SOIL-CONDITIONERS, WETTING AGENTS (organic fertilisers containing
added bacterial cultures, mycelia, or the like C05F 11/08; organic fertilisers containing plant
vitamins or hormones C05F 11/10); FERTILISERS CHARACTERISED BY THEIR FORM
1. This subclass covers mixtures of fertilisers with soil-conditioning or soil-stabilising materials characterised by their fertilizing
2. This subclass does not cover mixtures of fertilisers with soil-conditioning or soil-stabilising materials characterised by their
soil-conditioning or soil-stabilising activity, which are covered by group C09K 17/00.
The following IPC groups are not in the CPC scheme. The subject matter for these IPC groups is classified in the following
