COOPERATIVE PATENT CLASSIFICATION
FERTILISERS; MANUFACTURE THEREOF
ORGANIC FERTILISERS NOT COVERED BY SUBCLASSES C05B, C05C, e.g.
FERTILISERS FROM WASTE OR REFUSE {(breeding of earthworms A01K 67/0332)}
Processes where the composting step is the characterising feature, or apparatus therefor, are classified in group C05F 17/00.
The following IPC groups are not in the CPC scheme. The subject matter for these IPC groups is classified in the following
