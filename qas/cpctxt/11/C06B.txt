i. a consumable fuel component which consists of any element which is a metal, B, Si, Se or Te, or mixtures,
intercompounds, or hydrides thereof; and
ii. in combination an oxidant component which is either a metal oxide or a salt (organic or inorganic) capable of
yielding a metal oxide on decomposition;
c. fuels for rocket engines and intended for reaction with an oxidant, excluding air, in order to provide thrust for motive
