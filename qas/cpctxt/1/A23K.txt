   10/20    . from material of animal origin (obtained by
microbiological or biochemical processes
   10/26    . . from waste material, e.g. feathers, bones or skin
   10/28    . . . from waste dairy products

   10/32    . . from hydrolysates of wood or straw
   10/37    . . from waste material (from hydrolysates of
wood or straw A23K 10/32; from molasses

   10/40    . Mineral licks, e.g. salt blocks
   20/00    Accessory food factors for animal feeding-stuffs
   20/10    . Organic substances
   20/105   . . Aliphatic or alicyclic compounds
classification is also made in groups
A23K 20/174 - A23K 20/195 if the substance
   20/111   . . Aromatic compounds
   20/116   . . Heterocyclic compounds
   20/121   . . . containing oxygen or sulfur as hetero atom
   20/132   . . . containing only one nitrogen as hetero atom
   20/137   . . . containing two hetero atoms, of which at least
   20/142   . . Amino acids; Derivatives thereof
   20/147   . . . Polymeric derivatives, e.g. peptides or proteins
   20/153   . . Nucleic acids; Hydrolysis products or derivatives
   20/158   . . Fatty acids; Fats; Products containing oils or fats

   20/22    . . Compounds of alkali metals
In groups A23K 20/22 - A23K 20/28, the
last place priority rule is applied, i.e. at
each hierarchical level, in the absence of an
indication to the contrary, classification is
made in the last appropriate place.
   20/24    . . Compounds of alkaline earth metals, e.g.
   20/26    . . Compounds containing phosphorus
   20/28    . . Silicates, e.g. perlites, zeolites or bentonites
   20/30    . . {Oligoelements}

converted to proteins, e.g. ammonium salts or
   50/40    . for carnivorous animals, e.g. cats or dogs
   50/45    . . Semi-moist feed
When classifying in group A23K 50/60,
classification is also made in groups
A23K 50/10 - A23K 50/50 if the weanling is any
of the animals covered by those groups.
   50/80    . for aquatic animals, e.g. fish, crustaceans or
