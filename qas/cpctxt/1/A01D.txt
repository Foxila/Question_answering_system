COOPERATIVE PATENT CLASSIFICATION
AGRICULTURE; FORESTRY; ANIMAL HUSBANDRY; HUNTING; TRAPPING;
1. This subclass covers the shredding or pulverising of stubble, e.g. for the purpose of producing mulch, but does not cover other
mechanical destruction of unwanted vegetation, which is covered by group A01M 21/02
2. In this subclass, in groups A01D 34/00, A01D 42/00, A01D 43/00, A01D 57/00, A01D 67/00, A01D 69/00 and A01D 75/00,
it is desirable to add the indexing code of group A01D 2101/00
In this subclass non-limiting references (in the sense of paragraph 39 of the Guide to the IPC) may still be displayed in the
