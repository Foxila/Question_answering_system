COOPERATIVE PATENT CLASSIFICATION
INFORMATION STORAGE BASED ON RELATIVE MOVEMENT BETWEEN
RECORD CARRIER AND TRANSDUCER (recording measured values in a way that does
not require playback through a transducer G01D 9/00; recording or playback apparatus using
mechanically marked tape, e.g. punched paper tape, or using unit records, e.g. punched or
magnetically marked cards G06K; transferring data from one type of record carrier to another
G06K 1/18; circuits for coupling output of reproducer to radio receiver H04B 1/20; gramophone
pick-ups or like acoustic electromechanical transducers or circuits therefor H04R)
• recording or playback of information by relative movement between a record track and  a transducer, the transducer
directly producing, or being directly actuated by,  modulation in the track being recorded or played-back, and the extent of
modulation  corresponding to the signal being recorded or played-back;
• apparatus and machines for recording or playback, and parts thereof such as heads;
• record carriers for use with such apparatus and machines;
• associated working of other apparatus with such apparatus and machines;
• {relative positioning or movement of transducers and record carriers before, during or after transducing operation, e.g.
for accessing record carriers or parts thereof, or for track change, selection or acquisition or for track following or for
• {driving or moving of heads or record carriers or both heads and record carriers for increasing, maintaining or decreasing
the relative speed before, during or after transducing operation}
2. In this subclass, the following terms or expressions are used with the meanings indicated :
• "head" includes any means for converting sinusoidal or non-sinusoidal electric  wave-forms into variations of the physical
condition of at least the adjacent surface  of the record carrier, or vice versa;
• "record carrier" means a body, such as a cylinder, disc, card, tape, or wire, capable  of permanently holding information,
which can be read-off by a sensing element  movable relatively to the record carrier.
3. Documents concerning relative positioning or movement of transducers and record carriers are classified in groups
G11B 3/00 - G11B 7/00 and G11B 21/00 when only the transducer is controlled and in groups G11B 15/00, G11B 17/00 and
G11B 19/00 when only the record carrier is controlled. When both record carrier and head are controlled, the documents are
classified in G11B 15/1808, G11B 15/1816, G11B 19/00 and G11B 27/002.
When a plurality of record carriers are controlled, the documents are classified in G11B 15/68, G11B 17/08, G11B 17/22 and
4. By "access" is meant an operation including a relative movement for positioning between record carrier and head before,
during or after transducing; this operation including "seek", "select", "change", "acquire" and "follow" functions for at least
a part of a track on at least one record carrier. By "programmed access" is meant a sequence of access operations the result
of the sequence being to acquire a wanted sequence of parts of tracks or a wanted sequence of tracks. Relative movement
between head and record carrier also covers the movement of a coupling beam such as a light beam between the head and a
5. "Movement of the head" also covers any virtual movement or any physical movement such as obtained by switching between
successive transducing parts of the head or by moving the transducing zone of the head, i.e. by "scanning". If different
transducing parts of the head are switchable, the number of transducing parts should be much smaller than the number of
individual storage areas of the record carrier.
6. Attention is drawn to the notes of subclass G11C.
