1. In this subclass, the following term is used with the meaning indicated :
â€¢ "sign" designates a mark or indication serving to make something recognisable, the information presented being non-
varying, even if it is flashing; by way of example it covers, therefore, advertising hoardings, or luminous, or light
reflecting, safety arrangements.
2. Attention is drawn to the Notes following the titles of class B81 and subclass B81B relating to "microstructural devices" and
In this subclass non-limiting references (in the sense of paragraph 39 of the Guide to the IPC) may still be displayed in the
