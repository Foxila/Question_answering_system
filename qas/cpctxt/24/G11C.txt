COOPERATIVE PATENT CLASSIFICATION
STATIC STORES (semiconductor memory devices H10B)
1. This subclass covers devices or arrangements for storage of digital or analogue information:
• in which no relative movement takes place between an information storage element and a transducer;
• which incorporate a selecting-device for writing-in or reading-out the information into or from the store.
2. This subclass does not cover elements not adapted for storage and not provided with such means as referred to in Note (3)
below, which elements are classified in the appropriate subclass, e.g. of H01, H03K.
3. In this subclass, the following terms are used with the meaning indicated:
• "storage element" is an element which can hold at least one item of information and is provided with means for writing-in
or reading-out this information;
• "memory" is a device, including storage elements, which can hold information to be extracted when desired.
1. The following IPC groups are not in the CPC scheme. The subject matter for these IPC groups is classified in the following
2. In this subclass non-limiting references (in the sense of paragraph 39 of the Guide to the IPC) may still be displayed in the
