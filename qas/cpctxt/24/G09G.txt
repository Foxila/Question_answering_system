or arrangements for the control of light beams G02F 1/00; indicating of time by visual
means G04B 19/00, G04C 17/00, G04G 9/00; arrangements for transferring data between

1. This subclass covers indicator consoles, i.e. arrangements or circuits for processing control signals to achieve the display, e.g.
for the calling up, reception, storage, regeneration, coding, decoding, addressing of control signals.
2. This subclass does not cover the structural details of the indicating devices, such as panels or tubes per se, or assemblies of
individual light sources, which are covered by the relevant subclasses, e.g. H01J, H01K, H01L, H10K, G02F, G09F, H05B.
3. Contrary to subclass H04N, in which are classified display devices capable of representing continuous brightness value scales,
this subclass is limited to devices using only a discrete number of brightness values, e.g. visible/non-visible.
4. The visual effect may be produced by a luminescent screen scanned by an electron beam, directly by controlled light sources,
by projection of light, from controlled light sources onto characters, symbols, or elements thereof drawn on a support, or by
electric, magnetic, or acoustic control of the parameters of light rays from an independent source.
