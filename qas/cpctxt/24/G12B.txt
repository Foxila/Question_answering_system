COOPERATIVE PATENT CLASSIFICATION
CONSTRUCTIONAL DETAILS OF INSTRUMENTS, OR COMPARABLE DETAILS
OF OTHER APPARATUS, NOT OTHERWISE PROVIDED FOR
1. This subclass covers only details which are not restricted to measuring instruments or to any other apparatus covered by a
2. This subclass does not cover:
• details covered by any other subclass in section A, F, G or H. In particular, details restricted to the measuring instruments
are covered by the relevant subclasses of class G01, e.g. G01D;
• constructional details restricted to electric apparatus, e.g. casings, screenings, which are covered by subclass H05K or the
relevant subclass in section H.
3. Attention is drawn to the Notes following the title of section G, especially as regards to the definition of the term "measuring"
in Note (2) following the title of class G01.
In this subclass non-limiting references (in the sense of paragraph 39 of the Guide to the IPC) may still be displayed in the
