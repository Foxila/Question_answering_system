COOPERATIVE PATENT CLASSIFICATION
MECHANICAL ENGINEERING; LIGHTING; HEATING; WEAPONS; BLASTING
HEAT-EXCHANGE APPARATUS, NOT PROVIDED FOR IN ANOTHER SUBCLASS,
IN WHICH THE HEAT-EXCHANGE MEDIA COME INTO DIRECT CONTACT
WITHOUT CHEMICAL INTERACTION (safety devices in general F16P; fluid heaters
having heat generating means F24H; with an intermediate heat-transfer medium coming into
direct contact with heat-exchange media F28D 15/00 - F28D 19/00; details of heat-exchange
apparatus of general application F28F)
In this subclass non-limiting references (in the sense of paragraph 39 of the Guide to the IPC) may still be displayed in the
