STEAM OR VAPOUR CONDENSERS (condensation of vapours B01D 5/00; steam engine
plants having condensers F01K; liquefaction of gases F25J; details of heat-exchange and heat-
transfer arrangements of general application F28F)
In this subclass non-limiting references (in the sense of paragraph 39 of the Guide to the IPC) may still be displayed in the
    1/00    Condensers in which the steam or vapour is
separate from the cooling medium by walls, e.g.
    1/02    . using water or other liquid as the cooling medium
    1/04    . . employing moving walls
    1/06    . using air or other gas as the cooling medium
This group covers also air cooled heat
exchangers for which the use as condenser is
not explicitly specified, but the configuration is
similar to air cooled condensers, e.g. dry cooling
 2001/065   . . {with secondary condenser, e.g. reflux condenser
    1/08    . . employing moving walls
    3/00    Condensers in which the steam or vapour comes
into direct contact with the cooling medium
    3/02    . by providing a flowing coating of cooling liquid on
    3/04    . by injecting cooling liquid into the steam or vapour
    3/06    . by injecting the steam or vapour into the cooling
liquid (F28B 3/08 takes precedence)
    3/08    . with rotatable members
    5/00    Condensers employing a combination of the
methods covered by main groups F28B 1/00 and
    7/00    Combinations of two or more condensers, e.g.
    9/00    Auxiliary systems, arrangements, or devices
    9/005   . {for protection against freezing}
    9/02    . for feeding steam or vapour to condensers
    9/04    . for feeding, collecting, and storing cooling water or
    9/06    . . with provision for re-cooling the cooling water or
    9/08    . for collecting and removing condensate
    9/10    . for extracting, cooling, and removing non-
   11/00    Controlling arrangements with features specially
adapted for condensers (control arrangements in
