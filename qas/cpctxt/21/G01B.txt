COOPERATIVE PATENT CLASSIFICATION
MEASURING LENGTH, THICKNESS OR SIMILAR LINEAR DIMENSIONS;
MEASURING ANGLES; MEASURING AREAS; MEASURING IRREGULARITIES OF
1. This subclass covers measuring of position or displacement in terms of linear or angular dimensions.
2. In this subclass, the groups are distinguished by the measurement technique which is of major importance. Thus, the mere
application of other techniques or means for giving a final indication does not affect the classification.
3. Attention is drawn to the Notes following the title of class G01.
4. Machines operated on similar principles to the hand-held devices specified in this subclass are classified with these devices.
5. Measuring arrangements or details thereof covered by two or more of groups G01B 3/00 - G01B 17/00 are classified in group
G01B 21/00 if no single other group can be selected as being predominantly applicable.
{In this subclass non-limiting references (in the sense of paragraph 39 of the Guide to the IPC) may still be displayed in the
