COOPERATIVE PATENT CLASSIFICATION
MECHANICAL ENGINEERING; LIGHTING; HEATING; WEAPONS; BLASTING
APPARATUS FOR LAUNCHING PROJECTILES OR MISSILES FROM BARRELS,
e.g. CANNONS (smallarms F41C); LAUNCHERS FOR ROCKETS OR TORPEDOES;
HARPOON GUNS (functional features or details common to both smallarms and ordnance,
mountings therefor F41A; projecting missiles without use of explosive or combustible propellant
This subclass does not cover the arrangement of armaments, adaptation of mountings therefor, or arrangements of ammunition
handlers on ships or aircraft, if they present a shipbuilding or aircraft-building aspect, which are covered by subclass B63G or
In this subclass non-limiting references (in the sense of paragraph 39 of the Guide to the IPC) may still be displayed in the
